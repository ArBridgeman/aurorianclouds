## YouTube API
From Phind

To query YouTube using the OAuth 2.0 API with your email, you'll need to follow several steps to authenticate your application and make authorized requests to the YouTube Data API. Here's a step-by-step guide based on the information provided:

### Step 1: Set Up OAuth 2.0 Credentials
- Go to the Google Cloud Console (console.cloud.google.com).
- Create a new project or select an existing one.
- Navigate to the "Credentials" page under "APIs & Services".
- Click on "Create Credentials" and choose "OAuth client ID".
- Configure the consent screen as required.
- Select "Desktop app" as the application type since service accounts cannot be linked to YouTube accounts for API access [1].
- After creating the credentials, note down the Client ID and Client Secret.

### Step 2: Implement OAuth 2.0 Authorization Flow
- Direct users to Google's authorization server with a URL formatted like this: `https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth?client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&redirect_uri=YOUR_REDIRECT_URI&scope=https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube&response_type=code`
- Replace `YOUR_CLIENT_ID` with your actual client ID and `YOUR_REDIRECT_URI` with the redirect URI you set up in the Google Cloud Console.
- The `scope` parameter specifies the level of access your application needs. For querying YouTube, you might need scopes like `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube.readonly` for read-only access or `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube` for full access [3].

### Step 3: Obtain Access Token
- After the user consents, they will be redirected to your redirect URI with a `code` parameter.
- Exchange this code for an access token by making a POST request to Google's token endpoint (`https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token`) with parameters including `code`, `client_id`, `client_secret`, `redirect_uri`, and `grant_type=authorization_code`.

### Step 4: Make Authorized API Requests
- With the access token, you can now make authorized requests to the YouTube Data API on behalf of the authenticated user.
- Include the access token in your API requests either as a query parameter (`access_token=YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN`) or in the Authorization header (`Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN`) [3].

### Example API Request Using curl
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/channels?part=snippet&mine=true
```
Replace `YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN` with the actual access token obtained in Step 3.

### Best Practices
- Always use HTTPS for all communications between your application and Google's servers.
- Store refresh tokens securely on your server to avoid re-authentication prompts for users.
- Regularly review and minimize the scopes requested to enhance user trust and consent rates.

By following these steps, you can authenticate users via OAuth 2.0 and make authorized requests to the YouTube Data API using your email. Remember, the initial authentication flow requires user consent, but subsequent access can be facilitated through refresh tokens without further user interaction [2].
