Make sure you cut them to uniform sizes as this helps to fry all of them uniformly.\n\nIn a bowl, mix together seasoning and chicken. Sprinkle flour and coat the chicken well.\n\nPour the egg white to a small bowl and then the bread crumbs to another bowl. Place them side by side.\n\nPick up each piece of chicken & dip in the egg or buttermilk. Remove and roll in the bread crumbs. Place them in a wide plate. Repeat the same step until all the chicken bites are breaded.\n\nFor extra crunch you can also double coat the chicken pieces by dipping in egg mixture again and then rolling them in bread crumbs again.\n\nRest for 10 to 15 min for the bread crumbs to stick well to the pieces. If you have used buttermilk then it is good to rest them at least for an hour. You can also refrigerate up to 48 hours for further use.\n\nHow to make popcorn chicken\n\nHeat oil on a medium flame.\n\nWhen the oil is hot enough, check by dropping a small piece of bread crumb. It has to rise without browning a lot. 350 to 375 F is the right temperature if you are measuring.\n\nGently slide the pieces one after the other to the oil. Do not stir or disturb them for about a minute otherwise the bread crumbs may disperse in oil.\n\nDo not crowd the pan with many chicken bites at one time. Fry popcorn chicken in batches.\n\nDeep fry evenly till golden on a medium flame. Keep stirring after a minute or two for even frying.\n\nDrain popcorn chicken on a kitchen tissue and serve hot with ketchup, sauce or any other dip.\n\nSeasoning\n\nYou can sprinkle your favorite seasoning over popcorn chicken before serving. Sriracha or wasabi go great on these.","pictures":["/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/fr.recettetek/files/images/a30871ad-4abd-4927-b37e-1a27b506e194.png"],"url":"https://www.indianhealthyrecipes.com/popcorn-chicken-indian-recipe-kfc-style/","favorite":false,"rating":0.0,"lastModifiedDate":"2020-09-13 14:19:59","uuid":-589608780,"originalPicture":"https://www.indianhealthyrecipes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/popcorn-chicken-recipe.jpg","categories":[{"title":"Entree"}],"tags":[{"title":"poultry"},{"title":"American"}],"keywords":"poultry;American"},{"title":"Mango Salsa","preparationTime":"10","totalTime":"10","quantity":"1-2","ingredients":"1/2 Ripe Mango\r\n-3 Tbsp.

Use your fingers or a pastry blender to work the fat into the flour until it disappears. Coating most of the flour with fat inhibits gluten formation, making the tortillas easier to roll out., Pour in the lesser amount of hot water (plus the oil, if you're using it), and stir briskly with a fork or whisk to bring the dough together into a shaggy mass. Stir in additional water as needed to bring the dough together., Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured counter and knead briefly, just until the dough forms a ball. If the dough is very sticky, gradually add a bit more flour., Divide the dough into 8 pieces. Round the pieces into balls, flatten slightly, and allow them to rest, covered, for about 30 minutes (see tips, below). If you wish, coat each ball lightly in oil before covering; this ensures the dough doesn't dry out., While the dough rests, preheat an ungreased cast iron griddle or skillet over medium high heat, about 400°F., Working with one piece of dough at a time, roll into a round about 8\" in diameter. Keep the remaining dough covered while you work. Fry the tortilla in the ungreased pan for about 30 seconds on each side. Wrap the tortilla in a clean cloth when it comes off the griddle, to keep it pliable. Repeat with the remaining dough balls., If there are leftovers, allow them to cool completely, then wrap tightly in plastic and store in the refrigerator. Reheat in an ungreased skillet, or for a few seconds in the microwave.","pictures":["/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/fr.recettetek/files/images/8a383385-a4e3-4a3a-aa8f-3a969ad3190a.png"],"url":"https://www.kingarthurflour.com/recipes/simple-tortillas-recipe","favorite":false,"rating":0.0,"lastModifiedDate":"2020-09-13 14:19:59","uuid":-1606308109,"originalPicture":"https://www.kingarthurflour.com/sites/default/files/recipe_legacy/4723-3-large.jpg","categories":[{"title":"Dough"}]},{"title":"Tomatoes & Eggs","preparationTime":"5","cookingTime":"20","totalTime":"25","quantity":"2-4, with rice","ingredients":"6 eggs\nKosher salt\n½ teaspoon sesame oil\n1 tablespoon Shaoxing rice wine or dry sherry\n1 teaspoon cornstarch\n1 teaspoon sugar\n2 tablespoons ketchup\n1 pound beefsteak tomatoes in season, or 1 14.5-ounce can of diced tomatoes in juice\n4 tablespoons vegetable oil\n3 scallions, sliced\n1 tsp garlic, minced\n0.25 tsp ginger powder\nSteamed rice, for serving","instructions":"In a mixing bowl, beat the eggs well with 1 teaspoon salt, sesame oil and rice wine or sherry.

Otherwise, the amount of flour tends to be more than you need.)\n½ tsp baking powder (2 g)\n2 Tbsp sugar (25 g)\n1 Tbsp neutral-flavored oil (vegetable, canola, etc) (for greasing the pan)\n2 Tbsp water (for steaming)\n½ cup heavy (whipping) cream (120 ml)\n1 ½ Tbsp sugar (20 g)\n1 Tbsp confectioners’ sugar/powder sugar\nFresh berries\nmaple syrup","instructions":"Gather all the ingredients. You will also need a 12-inch non-stick frying pan (large enough to cook 3 pancakes at the same time) with a lid.\n\nSeparate egg whites and egg yolks into two different bowls. Put the bowl with egg whites in the freezer for 15 minutes. Why do we freeze egg whites? Please read 3 Tips to Make Perfect Meringue (Egg Whites) in this post.\n\nIn the meantime, add milk and vanilla to the egg yolks and whisk until thick and frothy.\n\nSift the cake flour and baking powder into the bowl.\n\nWhisk to combine thoroughly (but do not over-mix). Set aside.\n\nAfter 15 minutes, take out the bowl with egg whites from the freezer. The egg whites should be half frozen. Now start beating egg whites.\n\nWhen the egg whites turn frothy and pale white, gradually add in sugar (roughly ⅓ at a time). Continue to whip the egg whites.\n\nThe egg whites will become glossier and firmer. Stop beating when you lift up the hand mixer and the egg whites stand right up with stiff peaks slightly bending over.\n\nHeat the large non-stick frying pan to 300 ºF (150 ºC) over the lowest heat. Brush with cooking oil and lightly remove any visible oil (otherwise the pancakes will have a spotty pattern). Keep the heat on while you combine egg whites and egg yolk mixture. \n\nTake ⅓ of egg whites and add to the egg yolk mixture. Whisk together (don’t worry too much about breaking air bubbles at this step).\n\nNext, take half of the egg whites and add to the egg yolk mixture. Using a whisk, gently fold in without breaking the air bubbles in the egg whites. Why do we use a whisk instead of a silicone spatula? Please read 3 Tips to Make Perfect Meringue (Egg Whites) in this post.\n\nNow transfer the egg yolk mixture into egg whites. Carefully fold in two mixtures together without breaking the air bubbles. Make sure to gently mix the batter thoroughly!\n\nFor my stove and frying pan, I kept 300 ºF (150 ºC) all times on low heat. Remember each pancake gets roughly 4 scoops of batter, so that’s a total of 12 scoops for 3 pancakes. Now, scoop the batter and place on the frying pan. My recommendation is to use a small ladle (or a serving spoon that’s bigger than a regular spoon - probably 2-3 Tbsp) and make a tall pancake. Next, stack one more scoop to the first pancake. Then move on to the next two pancakes giving each 2 small scoops.\n\nBy the time all 3 pancakes have 2 scoops, the surface of the batter is slightly dry already, so you can stack one more scoop on top, keeping it up high. In the bowl, you should still have roughly 3 scoops left (if you have slightly more, that’s okay).\n\nSet timer for 6-7 minutes, add 1 Tbsp water in 3 empty spaces inside the pan and cover with the lid. Water keeps the pancake moist. Please note: the suggested time is just a guideline and it’s based on the stove and frying pan that I'm using.\n\nAfter 2 minutes passed, open the lid, and add one more scoop for each pancake (or more scoops if you have more batter). Make sure to stack high, not wide. If the water has evaporated, add a little bit more. Cover with lid and cook.\n\nAfter 6-7 minutes passed, using the offset spatula, lift the pancake VERY GENTLY. If you feel the pancake is stuck, don’t touch until they firm up a little. If you force it, the pancake will crack in the middle. When the pancake is ready, you can easily move the pancake.\n\nHere is another set of images to show the process. Slightly pull the pancake to create an empty space and gently flip over with “rolling over” motion.\n\nAdd water in empty spaces and set a timer for 4 to 5 minutes to cook the other side on the lowest heat.\n\nOnce they are nicely browned, transfer the pancakes to your serving plates. \n\nPlace fresh cream on the pancakes and top with berries. Dust the pancake with confectioners’ sugar and drizzle with maple syrup. Enjoy!\n\nPrepare an ice bath by putting ice cubes and water in a large bowl and placing a clean and dry mixing bowl over. Add heavy cream and sugar to keep cool.\n\nWhisk on high speed until medium to firm peaks form (should not be runny, but soft and fluffy firm whipped cream). Keep it chilled until you're ready to serve the pancakes.","pictures":["/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/fr.recettetek/files/images/d79e489e-e008-4aa1-87cb-24ab9cc2ead1.png"],"url":"https://www.justonecookbook.com/souffle-pancake/","favorite":true,"rating":3.5,"lastModifiedDate":"2020-09-13 14:19:59","uuid":-2103501128,"originalPicture":"https://www.justonecookbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Fluffy-Japanese-Souffle-Pancake-4.jpg","categories":[{"title":"Dough"},{"title":"Breakfast"}],"tags":[{"title":"Alex"},{"title":"Japanese"}],"keywords":"Alex;Japanese"},{"title":"Carne Asada","description":"!","preparationTime":"5","cookingTime":"20","totalTime":"25","quantity":"6 servings","ingredients":"1 1/2 lbs flank steak\n1/3 cup olive oil\n3 limes, juiced\n1/2 cup fresh cilantro, chopped\n4 garlic cloves, minced\n1 tsp cumin powder\n1/2 tsp chili powder\nsalt and pepper, to taste","instructions":"Whisk all of the marinade ingredients together in a small bowl. \n\nAdd the steak to glass baking tray and pour the marinade on top.

I am fascinated by the story behind the food – why we eat what we eat, how the foods of different cultures have evolved, and how yesterday’s food can inspire us in the kitchen today. Read more... Did you make one of my recipes? Tag @toriavey on Instagram or Twitter… I want to see! facebook  instagram  pinterest  twitter","preparationTime":"0","cookingTime":"40","totalTime":"40","quantity":"Servings servings","ingredients":"1 lb dry chickpeas/garbanzo beans - you must start with dry, do NOT substitute canned, they will not work!\n1 small onion, roughly chopped\n1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley\n3-5 cloves garlic (I prefer roasted garlic cloves)\n1 1/2 tbsp flour or chickpea flour\n1 3/4 tsp salt\n2 tsp cumin\n1 tsp ground coriander\n1/4 tsp black pepper\n1/4 tsp cayenne pepper\nPinch of ground cardamom\nVegetable oil for frying - grapeseed, sunflower, avocado, canola, and peanut oils all work well","instructions":"Pour the chickpeas into a large bowl and cover them by about 3 inches of cold water. Let them soak overnight. They will double in size as they soak – you will have between 4 and 5 cups of beans after soaking.\n\nDrain and rinse the garbanzo beans well. Pour them into your food processor along with the chopped onion, garlic cloves, parsley, flour or chickpea flour (use chickpea flour to make gluten free), salt, cumin, ground coriander, black pepper, cayenne pepper, and cardamom. NOTE: if you have a smaller food processor, you will want to divide the ingredients in half and process the mixture one batch at a time.\n\nPulse all ingredients together until a rough, coarse meal forms. Scrape the sides of the processor periodically and push the mixture down the sides. Process till the mixture is somewhere between the texture of couscous and a paste. You want the mixture to hold together, and a more paste-like consistency will help with that... but don't overprocess, you don't want it turning into hummus!\n\nOnce the mixture reaches the desired consistency, pour it out into a bowl and use a fork to stir; this will make the texture more even throughout. Remove any large chickpea chunks that the processor missed.\n\nCover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1-2 hours.\n\nNote: Some people like to add baking soda to the mix to lighten up the texture inside of the falafel balls. I don’t usually add it, since the falafel is generally pretty fluffy on its own. If you would like to add it, dissolve 2 tsp of baking soda in 1 tbsp of water and mix it into the falafel mixture after it has been refrigerated.\n\nFill a skillet with vegetable oil to a depth of 1 ½ inches. I prefer to use cooking oil with a high smoke point, like grapeseed. Heat the oil slowly over medium heat. The ideal temperature to fry falafel is between 360 and 375 degrees F; the best way to monitor the temperature is to use a deep fry or candy thermometer. After making these a few times, you will start to get a feel for when the oil temperature is \"right.\"\n\nMeanwhile, form falafel mixture into round balls or slider-shaped patties using wet hands or a falafel scoop. I usually use about 2 tbsp of mixture per falafel. You can make them smaller or larger depending on your personal preference. The balls will stick together loosely at first, but will bind nicely once they begin to fry. \n\nIf the balls won't hold together, place the mixture back in the processor again and continue processing to make it more paste-like. Keep in mind that the balls will be delicate at first; if you can get them into the hot oil, they will bind together and stick. If they still won't hold together, you can try adding 2-3 tbsp of flour or chickpea flour to the mixture. If they still won't hold, add 1-2 eggs to the mix. This should fix any issues you are having.\n\nBefore frying my first batch of falafel, I like to fry a test one in the center of the pan. If the oil is at the right temperature, it will take 2-3 minutes per side to brown (5-6 minutes total). If it browns faster than that, your oil is too hot and your falafels will not be fully cooked in the center. Cool the oil down slightly and try again. \n\nWhen the oil is at the right temperature, fry the falafels in batches of 5-6 at a time till golden brown on both sides. \n\nOnce the falafels are fried, remove them from the oil using a slotted spoon.\n\nLet them drain on paper towels. Serve the falafels fresh and hot; they go best with a plate of hummus and topped with creamy tahini sauce. You can also stuff them into a pita.\n\nTroubleshooting: If your falafel is too hard/too crunchy on the outside, there are two possible reasons-- 1) you didn't process the mixture enough-- return the chickpea mixture to the processor to make it more paste-like. 2) the chickpeas you used were old. Try buying a fresher batch of dried chickpeas next time.\n\nSESAME FALAFEL VARIATION: After forming the balls or patties, dip them in sesame seeds prior to frying. This will make the falafel coating crunchier and give it a slightly nutty flavor.\n\nHERB FALAFEL VARIATION (GREEN FALAFEL): Add ½ cup additional chopped green parsley, or cilantro, or a mixture of the two prior to blending.\n\nTURMERIC FALAFEL (YELLOW FALAFEL): Add ¾ tsp turmeric to the food processor prior to blending.\n\nEGYPTIAN FAVA BEAN FALAFEL: Use 1 lb. dried fava beans instead of chickpeas; cover them with cold water, soak them for at least 24 hours, then drain, rinse and peel them. You can also use a mixture of soaked fava beans and chickpeas if you wish; just make sure the weight of the dried beans adds up to 1 lb.\n\nAfter the beans are soaked and rinsed, add the Classic Falafel ingredients to the processor along with the following ingredients – 1 leek, cleaned, trimmed, and quartered; ¼ cup chopped dill; ¼ cup chopped cilantro; and an additional ¾ tsp cayenne pepper. When mixture is processed to a coarse meal, pour into a bowl. Stir 2 ½ tbsp sesame seeds into the mixture with a fork until it’s evenly dispersed throughout the mixture. Refrigerate and proceed with frying. If mixture seems too “wet” when making the falafel balls, add additional flour by the teaspoonful until the mixture sticks together better. Continue with frying.\n\nHOW TO MAKE A FALAFEL PITA: Making a falafel pita is actually really simple. The two main ingredients are pita bread and falafel. \n\nCut the pita bread in half to form two “pockets.” Each pocket is a serving size. Stuff the pocket with falafel, as well as any add-ons you fancy.\n\nHere are some traditional add-ons that can be added to your pita; these are the ingredients most widely available at falafel stands throughout Israel: Tahini sauce, shredded lettuce, diced or sliced tomatoes, Israeli salad, onions, dill pickles, hummus, tabouli, french fries\n\nHere are some less traditional add-ons that are also tasty: sprouts, cucumber slices, roasted peppers, roasted eggplant slices, sunflower seeds, feta cheese, yogurt, tzatziki","pictures":["/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/fr.recettetek/files/images/ce5a18b8-085a-4e8c-ae3e-862d086dd6cb.png"],"url":"https://toriavey.com/toris-kitchen/falafel/","nutrition":"Nutrition FactsFalafel Amount Per Serving Calories 409 Calories from Fat 153 % Daily Value* Fat 17g26% Saturated Fat 1g6% Sodium 700mg30% Potassium 720mg21% Carbohydrates 50g17% Fiber 13g54% Sugar 8g9% Protein 15g30% Vitamin A 300IU6% Vitamin C 8.7mg11% Calcium 96mg10% Iron 5.5mg31%* Percent Daily Values are based on a 2000 calorie diet.","favorite":false,"rating":0.0,"lastModifiedDate":"2020-09-13 14:20:00","uuid":-1850736856,"originalPicture":"https://toriavey.com/images/2011/01/Falafel-10-640x480-1.jpg","categories":[{"title":"Entree"}],"tags":[{"title":"plant protein"},{"title":"Greek"},{"title":"vegan"}],"keywords":"plant protein;Greek;vegan"},{"title":"Balsamic Vinaigrette","description":"Why get store-bought dressing when you can make this in just 5 min?

In a large mixing bowl, whisk the dry ingredients together. Add the wet ingredient mixture into the dry ingredient mixture and use a spatula or clean hand to form the dough. If you are using a different all-purpose gluten-free flour than indicated in the Note, the wetness of your dough might be different. Add 1 tablespoon of extra milk at a time, if necessary, to form a slightly sticky dough but not too wet. Cover the mixing bowl and let the dough rise in a warm place for 5 hours. The dough should smell yeasty at the end of the fermentation.\n\nLightly dust a working surface with some gluten-free flour and transfer the yeast dough onto the surface. Roll the dough gently to form a smooth ball and then flatten the ball to form a disc.\n\nDivide the dough into 8 pieces and roll each piece into a small smooth ball. Use a rolling pin to form each ball into an oval-shaped disc, approximately 1/8 inch thick.\n\nLightly brush a thin layer of olive oil on top of the naan and sprinkle with sesame seeds or cumin seeds.\n\nStove Top Method: Heat a cast-iron pan over high heat. When the pan is smoky hot, lightly brush some oil and place the flattened naan dough into the pan, one at a time. Cover with lid and reduce the heat to medium. Cook each side for 1-1/2 minutes. Repeat the process until the dough disks are finished.\n\nOven Method: Set the oven to broil. Lightly grease a metal baking sheet. Place a few dough disks on the baking sheet and keep them ½ inch apart. Place the baking sheet on the top rack. Bake each side for 1 to 1-1/2 minutes depends on your oven setting. When you see the dough is forming large bubbles, it’s ready to flip to the other side.\n\nThese gluten-free naan breads are best when served hot. They can be kept in a freezer up to a month.

Cut a piece of waxed paper longer than the parchment and spray one side with baking spray. Place it oil-side-down on the dough and begin rolling out the crackers.

It’s hearty and satisfying and warms the soul with its deep smoky flavors. The prep time is relatively short and the oven does much of the work. During the cold months, I try to utilize the oven as much as possible. It warms the whole house, and just feels good.There is nothing quite as satisfying as a simple roast chicken, just pulled from the oven, aromas wafting through house, infusing hearth and home with warmth and comfort. Winter has arrived, dropping snow on the fallen leaves. It seemed to happen so quickly this year, the changing of the seasons. My initial reaction, truthfully, is resistance, to the abrupt ending of fall and the beginning of the long winter to come. And yet, I’m lured into acceptance by little things – the sound of the crackling fire, the snowflakes, the stack of books waiting to be read and comforting meals. Smoked paprika, dried ancho chilies and fresh garlic are at the base of this flavorful marinade. This is  a “manly” dish, meaning, in general, men tend to gravitate towards these deep, smoky flavors.  It looks spicy, but don’t be deceived –  this version is not over-the-top spicy, and I’d only call it a “one-star” on the spiciness scale. It really lets the other flavors come through.Traditional Portuguese Chicken, also called Peri Peri Chicken (or sometimes Piri Piri Chicken) is made with Piri Piri peppers which actually originated in South Africa, and were imported to Portugal from two Portuguese colonies, Angola and Mozambique, on spice ships. Today, the peppers are used widespread throughout Portugal to make marinades, basting liquids, condiments and hot sauces.Unfortunately peri peri peppers aren’t easily available here, or if they are, I haven’t found them, so for this recipe, I substituted less spicy Ancho Chilies. This is a one star dish, as far as heat goes. So if you like heat, you may want to add more. The Ancho Chilies also add a nice depth to the marinade. I haven’t tried it yet, but  my guess is that if this marinade were rubbed lavishly on tofu and baked in the oven, it would be just as good as the chicken. So vegetarians, try it on tofu and let me know. And you may want to skip the next few pictures.You can butterfly a whole chicken for this recipe, or roast it whole, or buy pre-cut bone-in, skin-on pieces.Butterflying the chicken ( also called spatchcocking)  allows it to cook fast and evenly, and is a fun technique to learn.You can also use boneless skinless breast or thighs, to make this a little more healthy, but, I’ll be honest, there is something about the crispy skin that is ohhhh so gratifying! We don’t eat this too often, so when we do, I want the skin!To butterfly, start by placing the chicken (rinsed, patted dry)  breast side down on a cutting board.Using sharp kitchen scissors, remove the spine, cutting on one side and then the other side of the spine. Open the chicken wide and turn over, so breast side is now facing up.With the back side open and facing down, press down firmly on the breast bone of the chicken to flatten. You may hear some cracking. Press hard. In a blender or food processor, blend the marinade ingredients into a thick paste.  Brush the marinade all over both sides of the chicken, saving the rest for basting while in the oven.If making the potatoes that go with this, brush marinade on the bottom of your sheet pan. Sweet potatoes would also work well.Do not use a ceramic or glass pyrex here- use a large, rimmed, metal sheet pan for best results. This enamel pan is deceiving, it is very large.Layer thinly sliced potatoes, overlapping only slighlty,  and sprinkle generously with salt.Place the chicken, skin side down, tucking the wings under, over top of the potatoes and place in a 425F pre-heated  oven.\nAfter 15 minutes, turn the chicken over and roast for another 15 minutes, basting with more marinade after flipping. Continue cooking until chicken is cooked through, and leg reaches 165F.  Depending on the size of the chicken, this could be 20-50 more minutes! Then give a good broil in the oven so skin gets crispy and slightly charred in places. This is important!The flavorful juices from the Peri peri Chicken and marinade will seep into the potatoes which will have softened and also become crispy, a nice contrast. Place it in the oven.Once the Peri Peri Chicken is cooked through, let rest for 5 minutes.The crispy potatoes are deliciously addicting, and the chicken comes out perfectly crispy and delicious.Serve the Portuguese Chicken this with a cooling cilantro yogurt sauce (this is not imperative if pressed for time) but does really elevate the meal!Crispy, smoky, deep and flavorful.Hope you enjoy!

Remove stem and seeds.Butterfly the chicken: Rinse inside and out, removing innards. Pat dry. Place on a cutting board, breast down. Using sharp kitchen scissors, cut along both sides of the spine, remove and discard. Turn the chicken over, and placing your hand on the breast bone, press down hard with the palm of your hand, to flatten.Make the marinade by blending the marinade ingredients into a paste with a blender or food processor. Brush a layer of the marinade on the bottom of your large sheet pan.Place the thinly sliced potatoes on top of the marinade and sprinkle with a generous pinch of kosher salt,  overlapping slightly but not too much.Brush all sides and crevasses of the chicken with the marinade, coating fairly heavily. (You will add more marinade during cooking, so be sure to save the remaining.) Place chicken, skin side down on the potatoes and place in the hot oven.Turn chicken over after 15 minutes, and place back in the oven. After 15 minutes, brush more marinade all over the chicken on the skin side, really lathering it up. Return to the oven and bake until cooked through another 15-30 minutes, or until leg/ thigh reaches an internal temperature of 165 F.  The bigger the chicken, the longer this will take. ( A large, 5-6 pound chicken may take an additional 20 minutes!) To crisp the skin and get it deeply brown, broil for a few minutes. A little char is good here!!! Remove chicken when done and let rest 5-10 minutes before serving. Cut chicken into pieces and serve.While chicken is roasting, combine Cilantro Sauce ingredients together, either in a bowl- mixing by hand, or in a food processor. Serve cilantro sauce on the side.NotesFor a healthier version, use skinless boneless chicken thighs, or breast. Feel free to marinate overnight in a zip lock bag. Cooking time will shorten significantly, so you may have to remove chicken and let potatoes continue cooking to get them crispy.For WHOLE CHICKENS! The baking time for the chicken will vary depending on the size (weight) of the chicken. This one in the photos was a small 3.5 pound chicken. Larger 5-6 lb chickens will take longer in the oven ( 70-90 minutes). So plan accordingly.Use a large rimmed metal sheet pan, rather than a glass baking dish so air can circulate and potatoes can get crispy!

Finely grate 50g pecorino cheese and 50g parmesan and mix them together.\n\nBeat the 3 large eggs in a medium bowl and season with a little freshly grated black pepper. Set everything aside.\n\nAdd 1 tsp salt to the boiling water, add 350g spaghetti and when the water comes back to the boil, cook at a constant simmer, covered, for 10 minutes or until al dente (just cooked).\n\nSquash 2 peeled plump garlic cloves with the blade of a knife, just to bruise it.\n\nWhile the spaghetti is cooking, fry the pancetta with the garlic. Drop 50g unsalted butter into a large frying pan or wok and, as soon as the butter has melted, tip in the pancetta and garlic.\n\nLeave to cook on a medium heat for about 5 minutes, stirring often, until the pancetta is golden and crisp. The garlic has now imparted its flavour, so take it out with a slotted spoon and discard.\n\nKeep the heat under the pancetta on low. When the pasta is ready, lift it from the water with a pasta fork or tongs and put it in the frying pan with the pancetta. Don’t worry if a little water drops in the pan as well (you want this to happen) and don’t throw the pasta water away yet.\n\nMix most of the cheese in with the eggs, keeping a small handful back for sprinkling over later.\n\nTake the pan of spaghetti and pancetta off the heat. Now quickly pour in the eggs and cheese. Using the tongs or a long fork, lift up the spaghetti so it mixes easily with the egg mixture, which thickens but doesn’t scramble, and everything is coated.\n\nAdd extra pasta cooking water to keep it saucy (several tablespoons should do it).

I shied away from using butter and brown sugar. But after many many tries, it works consistently. And since I use both butter and sugar in my morning oatmeal, I said to myself, what's a little more?

Stir to combine. Cook until bubbles begin forming on surface. Turn heat down to medium and cook for an additional minute.\n\nAdd butter mixture into oat mixture. Stir to evenly combine. Set aside to cool for 5 minutes.\nMeanwhile, get out two 9 x 9″ square metal pans. Line one with wax or parchment paper. Chop chocolate bars into chunks.\n\nOnce granola bar mixture has cooled, stir in chocolate reserving a couple chocolate chunks.\nPour granola bar mixture into prepared pan.

The dough may crack slightly but the more you fold it and put it through the roller dusted with flour, the smoother it will get.

They didn’t even balk about the spinach. \uD83D\uDE42 It’s a keeper and will definitely become a regular dinner in my home. Thanks, Mel!","preparationTime":"15","cookingTime":"35","totalTime":"50","quantity":"4-6 servings","ingredients":"3/4 cup all-purpose flour\n1/2 tablespoon salt\n1 teaspoon pepper\n1/2 teaspoon dried basil\n1/2 teaspoon dried oregano\n4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts\n5 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, divided\n1 tablespoon finely minced garlic (about 4-5 cloves)\n1 red bell pepper, cut into thin strips or chopped\n1/2 cup low-sodium chicken broth\n6 ounces fresh spinach\n1/2 cup heavy cream\n2 teaspoons cornstarch\n1 cup lowfat milk\n1 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese\n1 pound fettuccine","instructions":"Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.\n\nIn a shallow pie plate or similar dish, combine the flour, salt, pepper, basil and oregano. Dip each chicken piece in the flour mixture until both sides are well coated.\n\nIn a large 12-inch nonstick skillet, heat 3 tablespoons of the olive oil over medium heat until the oil is hot and shimmering. Carefully place the chicken breasts in the pan, cooking them for 2-3 minutes on each side, until they are golden and browned but not cooked all the way through (they’ll finish up in the oven). Don’t scoot the chicken around once you lay it in the hot oil! Let the oil work it’s magic to sear the crust on the chicken. If you get all antsy and try flipping too early and/or moving the chicken around the pan, the breading is lightly to fall off. Gently remove the chicken to a foil-lined, lightly greased baking sheet and bake in the preheated oven for about 15 minutes, until the chicken is cooked through. Set aside and tent with foil until ready to use.\n\nWhile the chicken is cooking, heat a large pot of water to a boil and add the noodles, cooking until al dente. Also, wipe out the skillet with a couple paper towels and return it to medium heat, adding the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil. When the oil is hot, add the garlic and bell pepper, sauteing for 2-3 minutes.\n\nStir in one tablespoon flour and stir constantly while cooking for another minute. Add the chicken broth to the skillet and bring the mixture to a low simmer, whisking constantly, until slightly thickened, about 3-4 minutes. In a small liquid measure, whisk together the cornstarch and cream. Add the spinach, milk and cream mixture to the skillet. Bring the mixture to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until the spinach is wilted and sauce is slightly thickened, about 2-4 minutes. Stir in the Parmesan cheese. Add additional salt and pepper to the sauce, if needed!\n\nWhen the pasta has finished cooking, drain and return it to the pot. Toss the pasta with half of the cheese sauce. Place some of the coated pasta on each plate. Top with a breaded chicken breast and spoon some of the sauce over the top of the chicken and pasta. Serve immediately.\n\nNOTES\n\nIf the chicken breasts you are using are overly thick, you can butterfly them, cutting all the way through so you end up with two thinner cuts of chicken breast.\n\nSecond note: I would say this recipe is right on the edge of just having enough sauce but not an overabundance, so if you like things on the saucier end of the spectrum, feel free to double that part of the recipe.\n\n","pictures":["/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/fr.recettetek/files/images/943016b8-a3da-49ea-a342-03c4d8137160.png"],"url":"http://www.melskitchencafe.com/tuscan-garlic-chicken/","favorite":false,"rating":0.0,"lastModifiedDate":"2020-09-13 14:20:00","uuid":424490064,"originalPicture":"https://www.melskitchencafe.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Tuscan-Garlic-Front-View-jpg.jpg","categories":[{"title":"Entree"}],"tags":[{"title":"poultry"},{"title":"Italian"}],"keywords":"poultry"},{"title":"Spaghetti (Bridgeman-style)","preparationTime":"5","cookingTime":"45","totalTime":"50","quantity":"3-4 meals","ingredients":"0.5 kg ground meat\r\n3 cans diced tomatoes\r\n1 can tomato sauce\r\n0.5c chopped onions\r\n4 garlic cloves, minced\r\nlots of Italian seasoning\r\ndash of salt, black and red pepper\r\n2 bay leaves (Lorbeerblätter)","instructions":"Cook ground meat in pan on medium heat.

Wrap tortillas tightly in foil. Heat in oven about 10 minutes or until heated through.\n\nTo Make the Filling:  In a large saucepan, cook onion and garlic in the 1 teaspoon hot oil until tender. Stir in chicken, black beans, 1/2 cup bottled salsa, the cheese, and 2 tablespoons cilantro.\n\nTo Fry  the Flautas:  Spoon about 1/2 cup of filling across each warm tortilla about 1-1/2 inches from one edge. Roll up tortillas as tightly as possible. Secure with wooden toothpicks. In a very large, deep skillet, heat 1-1/2 inches of cooking oil to 365 degrees. Fry flautas, two at a time, for 2 to 3 minutes or until crisp and golden brown, turning once. Drain on paper towels. Keep fried flautas warm in a 300 degree oven while frying remaining flautas.\nTo Bake Flautas: Prepare filling and shape flautas as directed. Place flautas on a large baking sheet and brush with 1 tablespoon cooking oil. Bake in a 350 degree  oven for 30 to 40 minutes or until golden brown and heated through.\nTo Serve:  Remove toothpicks. Halve flautas crosswise. If desired, serve with guacamole, salsa, sour cream, and cilantro. \n\nThe dipping sauce is Jalapeno Jelly.\n\nTo Make the Jelly:  Combine the peppers, jalapenos, sugar, vinegar, and lime juice in a large saucepan over medium heat. Cook until warm and sugar is dissolved. Pour the mixture in a blender or food processor and blend for 5 seconds. Return the blended mixture to the saucepan and bring to a boil. Skim off any foam that rises to the surface. Decrease the heat to low and simmer for 5 minutes. Stir in the pectin, increase the heat to medium high, and bring to a boil. Remove from heat and cool.  The jelly will set as it cools. Once cool cover and refrigerate. The jalapeno jelly will keep for 5-6 days.","pictures":["/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/fr.recettetek/files/images/c113682f-cddc-43c2-ab43-c2afbe5f694f.png"],"url":"https://finallytherightrecipe.blogspot.com/2018/10/chevys-chicken-flautas-copycat-recipe.html?spref=pi","favorite":false,"rating":3.5,"lastModifiedDate":"2020-09-13 14:20:00","uuid":-1952934047,"originalPicture":"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-YgkQBEwkRAk/UBLAffTyNXI/AAAAAAAALEs/TZ8AXQRYeAw/s280/chicken+flautas.jpg","categories":[{"title":"Entree"}],"tags":[{"title":"poultry"},{"title":"Mexican"}],"keywords":"poultry;Mexican"},{"title":"Chicken Tacos","description":"My first chicken tacos and we loved them!!!  I added corn to the salsa and did not purchase the chipotle chili powder. Other than that I did everything. My husband said I made his day, he said they are delicious. Will definitely make them again.","totalTime":"45","quantity":"serves 4","ingredients":"1 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n1/2 teaspoon pepper\n2 tablespoons olive oil\n2 teaspoons ground cumin\n1 teaspoon smoked paprika\n1/2 teaspoon chile powder\n1/2 teaspoon garlic powder\n1/4 teaspoon chipotle chili powder\n1/2 teaspoon onion powder\n1 cup grape tomatoes, quartered\n1/2 red onion, finely diced\n1/4 cup fresh cilantro, chopped\n1 lime, juiced\n8 to 12 (4-inch) tortillas, flour or corn – your preference!\n4 ounces queso fresco cheese, crumbled\n1 avocado, sliced\nextra limes for garnishquick chipotle lime crema\n3 tablespoons greek yogurt\n3/4 cup half and half\n1 tablespoon adobo sauce (from a can of chipotles in adobo)\njuice of half a lime\nzest of half a lime\n1/8 teaspoon salt","instructions":"Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.Heat a large oven-safe skillet over medium-high heat. Season the chicken with the salt and pepper. Add the olive oil to the skillet and once it’s hot, add in the chicken. Brown the chicken on both sides, about 2 minutes per side. Cover the skillet and place it in the oven, roasting for 20 minutes. In a bowl, combine the cumin, paprika, chili powders, garlic powder and onion power in a bowl. Set aside.While the chicken is cooking, combine the diced onion, tomatoes and cilantro in a bowl with the juice of the lime. Add a sprinkle of salt and pepper. Set aside.In another bowl, whisk together the yogurt, half and half, adobo, lime juice and zest and salt, whisking well to combine. Set aside.As soon as the chicken is finished cooking, add it to the bowl of your electric mixer, or a bowl that you can use a hand mixer with. If you used the chicken thighs, there will be juices in the pan – leave them in the pan and do not discard them because we will use them! Turn the mixer on to low speed for a few seconds to break up the chicken. Add in the spices that you mixer before and mix the chicken on low speed for a full minute or two to completely shred it and mixx with the spices.

(Or, use a frying pan for this step). Working in batches if necessary to avoid crowding, add the pork pieces and sear them on the first side without moving them until well browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Turn the pieces and sear on the second side until well browned, 3 to 4 minutes longer. Transfer to a plate and set aside.\n\n3Pour off all but 2 tablespoons of the fat from the insert and return the insert to medium-high heat. Add the yellow onion and sear, without stirring, until browned, about 5 minutes. Stir in the garlic, ginger, and 1 cup of the broth and deglaze the insert, stirring and scraping up any browned bits from the insert bottom, then let simmer for 1 minute.\n\n4If you have included the browning step, transfer the insert to the slow cooker, add the leek, mushrooms, and the remaining 7 cups of broth, and stir to combine. If you are starting here, combine the pork, yellow onion, garlic, ginger, leek, mushrooms, and broth in the slow cooker. Cover and cook on the low-heat setting for 8 hours. The pork should be very tender and the broth should be fragrant.\n\n1Transfer the pork to a cutting board. Using 2 forks, break the pork into bite-size chunks, removing and discarding any large pieces of fat. Strain the broth through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl and discard the solids. Using a large spoon, skim off and discard any fat from the surface of the broth. Return the pork and broth to the slow cooker and season to taste with soy sauce and sesame and/or chile oil. Cover and cook on the low-heat setting for about 30 minutes to warm through.\n\n2Cook the ramen noodles according to the package directions. If you want to top each bowl of ramen with an egg, put the eggs into boiling water and simmer for 5 to 6 minutes. Remove the eggs from the water, let cool until they can be handled, and peel them.\n\n1Divide the noodles evenly among individual bowls. Ladle the broth and pork over the noodles, dividing them evenly, then sprinkle with the green onions.

Generously butter an 8-inch springform pan and put it on a baking sheet lined with a silicone baking mat or parchment paper and put the springform on it.\n\nWhisk the flour, baking powder, and salt together in small bowl.\nPeel the apples, cut them in half and remove the cores. Cut the apples into 1- to 2-inch chunks.\n\nIn a medium bowl, beat the eggs with a whisk until they're foamy. Pour in the sugar and whisk for a minute or so to blend. Whisk in the rum and vanilla. Whisk in half the flour and when it is incorporated, add half the melted butter, followed by the rest of the flour and the remaining butter, mixing gently after each addition so that you have a smooth, rather thick batter. Switch to a rubber spatula and fold in the apples, turning the fruit so that it's coated with batter. Scrape the mix into the pan and poke it around a little with the spatula so that it's evenish.\n\nSlide the pan into the oven and bake for 50 to 60 minutes, or until the top of the cake is golden brown and a knife inserted deep into the center comes out clean; the cake may pull away from the sides of the pan. Transfer to a cooling rack and let rest for 5 minutes.\n\nCarefully run a blunt knife around the edges of the cake and remove the sides of the springform pan. (Open the springform slowly, and before it's fully opened, make sure there aren't any apples stuck to it.) Allow the cake to cool until it is just slightly warm or at room temperature. If you want to remove the cake from the bottom of the springform pan, wait until the cake is almost cooled, then run a long spatula between the cake and the pan, cover the top of the cake with a piece of parchment or wax paper, and invert it onto a rack. Carefully remove the bottom of the pan and turn the cake over onto a serving dish.\n\nServing The cake can be served warm or at room temperature, with or without a little softly whipped, barely sweetened heavy cream or a spoonful of ice cream. Marie-Hélène's served her cake with cinnamon ice cream and it was a terrific combination.\n\nStoring The cake will keep for about 2 days at room temperature and, according to my husband, gets more comforting with each passing day. However long you keep the cake, it's best not to cover it - it's too moist. Leave the cake on its plate and just press a piece of plastic wrap or wax paper against the cut surfaces.","pictures":["/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/fr.recettetek/files/images/a1937c1c-3ea2-411f-b4b7-b37f711004ac.png"],"url":"http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/marie-helenes-apple-cake-361150","nutrition":"Nutritional Info\nCalories 306\nCarbohydrates 43 g(14%)\nFat 13 g(20%)\nProtein 3 g(6%)\nSaturated Fat 8 g(39%)\nSodium91 mg(4%)\nPolyunsaturated Fat1 g\nFiber3 g(12%)\nMonounsaturated Fat3 g\nCholesterol77 mg(26%)\nper serving (8 servings)\nPowered by Edamam","favorite":false,"rating":4.0,"lastModifiedDate":"2020-09-13 14:20:01","uuid":-1432477495,"originalPicture":"http://assets.epicurious.com/photos/56098f066a59cdb91b5f789a/1:1/w_600%2Ch_600/361150.jpg","categories":[{"title":"Dessert"}],"tags":[{"title":"vegetarian"},{"title":"Alex"}],"keywords":"vegetarian;Alex"},{"title":"Chicken Piccata","description":"Wholesome recipes, delicious food","preparationTime":"10 minutes","cookingTime":"10","totalTime":"20","quantity":"Servings 4 -6 servings","ingredients":"4 medium sized chicken breasts\n1 cup walnuts\nSalt and Pepper\n3 tbsp olive oil\n2 cloves garlic crushed\n2 lemons\n1 cup chicken broth\n2 tbsp drained capers\n2 tbsp chopped fresh parsley\n2 tsp arrowroot starch optional\n1 tbsp water","instructions":"Begin by heating up a large skillet to medium high heat.\n\nWhile pan is heating, pound chicken breasts so they are about 1/2 inch thick.

Add the garlic or shallots and saute for a minute or two, until soft and fragrant. Add the arborio rice, stir to coat with butter. Add the white wine and enjoy the sizzles. Add the broth, 1/2 cup at a time, and simmer/stir after each addition until the rice is soft and creamy. I usually err on the side of more liquid to get a creamier texture. Add the parmesan and stir until incorporated. Salt + pepp to taste.\nFor the Seared Scallops: Heat oil in nonstick skillet. Pat scallops dry (VERY DRY, as dry as possible), sprinkle with salt, and add to pan. They should sizzle (if not, you need a hotter pan.) Shake gently to prevent sticking. After 2-3 minutes, flip each scallop over. They should have a pretty golden brown exterior and an opaque inside. Transfer to a paper towel lined plate to absorb excess oil. Serve immediately.\nFor the Sautéed Spinach: Heat the oil over medium low heat. Add the garlic, stir for a minute to get the flavor going. Add the spinach or kale and stir until wilted.\nFor the Brown Butter: Put a few tablespoons of butter in a clean skillet over medium heat and stir it while watching it closely – when it starts to look golden and foamy, remove from heat, transfer to a heat-proof bowl to cool slightly, then drizzle over the risotto, scallops, and greens.","pictures":["/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/fr.recettetek/files/images/9a125f93-7b5c-4931-b431-11e377716915.png"],"url":"http://pinchofyum.com/brown-butter-scallops-parmesan-risotto","nutrition":"3733.9 g1110.3 mg26.5 g19.9 g14.8 g53.6 mg","favorite":false,"rating":0.0,"lastModifiedDate":"2020-09-13 14:20:01","uuid":-576834969,"originalPicture":"https://pinchofyum.com/wp-content/uploads/Scallop-Risotto-4-2-1-Homepage.jpg","categories":[{"title":"Entree"}],"tags":[{"title":"Italian"},{"title":"seafood"}],"keywords":"Italian;seafood"},{"title":"Käsespätzle","preparationTime":"15","cookingTime":"20","totalTime":"35","quantity":"4","ingredients":"1 kg Spätzle, frische, aus dem Kühlregal\n400 ml Sahne/Milch\n200 g Emmentaler/Berg, geriebener\n1  Zwiebel(n), in Würfeln\n  Salz und Pfeffer\n  Butter","instructions":"Die gewürfelte Zwiebel in etwas Butter glasig anbraten.

Add the oil, garlic, oregano, red pepper flakes, and salt and cook just until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the chopped tomatoes, the water, 1 cup of the chicken broth, and the pasta to the pan, stirring to combine. Bring the mixture to a vigorous simmer, then cover the pan and continue simmering (you may need to reduce the heat slightly) until the pasta is tender, about 16-18 minutes. Stir the pasta frequently as it cooks.\n\nOnce tender, remove the cover and stir in 3/4 cup of the Parmesan cheese, the pepper, and the chicken. Season to taste with additional salt and pepper if necessary. If the mixture seems dry, mix in as much of the remaining 1/2 cup of chicken broth as needed to loosen it up (I didn’t add any of it). \n\n{Note: if you don’t have an oven-safe skillet, transfer the mixture to a baking dish at this point.} Sprinkle the top evenly with the mozzarella cheese and the remaining Parmesan cheese. Transfer the pan to the oven and bake for 5-10 minutes, or until the cheese has melted and bubbles around the edges. Garnish with the basil then serve.","pictures":["/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/fr.recettetek/files/images/e1cfe463-e7ac-4df1-9c71-4b711d96621b.png"],"url":"http://traceysculinaryadventures.com/2013/03/chicken-parmesan-baked-pasta.html","favorite":false,"rating":0.0,"lastModifiedDate":"2020-09-13 14:20:01","uuid":-1068962666,"originalPicture":"http://traceysculinaryadventures.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/logo.png","categories":[{"title":"Entree"}],"tags":[{"title":"poultry"},{"title":"Italian"}],"keywords":"poultry"},{"title":"Pizza - Zucchini Crust","preparationTime":"10","cookingTime":"30","totalTime":"40","quantity":"1","ingredients":"2 cups packed freshly shredded raw zucchini\n1 large egg\n1/4 cup freshly shredded Parmesan cheese\n1/8 tsp black pepper\n1/4 cup all purpose flour","instructions":"1. Preheat oven to 450F. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.\n2. Add zucchini to a large bowl and let sit 10-15 minutes. Drain excess water from zucchini bowl. Using a tea towel or several sturdy paper towels, add in 1/2 cup of zucchini into towel and wring dry. Repeat with remaining zucchini. When you are finished, you should have about 1 cup of zucchini remaining.\n3. Add zucchini, egg, cheese, pepper and flour to a large mixing bowl. Mix until all ingredients are thoroughly combined.\n4. Dump zucchini mixture onto baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Using a spatula, thin and spread out the batter so that it forms a round crust approximately 9 inches in diameter and 1/8 inch thick.\n5. Bake in oven about 15-20 minutes or until edges are golden brown and both sides are cooked. Flip over crust and bake an additional 10 minutes until top is crispy. Flip pizza crust back over.\n6. Lower oven temperature to 400F. Add whatever pizza ingredients you desire to your crust. I did a layer of marinara sauce, followed by fresh slices of mozzarella, sliced bell peppers and fresh basil leaves. Bake for about 8-10 minutes or until cheese is melted. Serve immediately.","pictures":["/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/fr.recettetek/files/images/4c84b7ac-7e76-4eaa-9dd9-0043cf1c754c.png"],"url":"http://kirbiecravings.com/2016/03/zucchini-crust-pizza.html","favorite":false,"rating":3.5,"lastModifiedDate":"2020-09-13 14:20:01","uuid":-290321382,"originalPicture":"http://kirbiecravings.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/zucchini-crust-pizza-22-2-1-1.jpg","categories":[{"title":"Dough"},{"title":"Pizza/Flammkuchen"}],"tags":[{"title":"vegetarian"},{"title":"veggies"},{"title":"milk protein"},{"title":"Alex"},{"title":"low-carb"}],"keywords":"vegetarian;veggies;milk protein;Alex;low-carb"},{"title":"Creamy Chicken Spinach Skillet","preparationTime":"3","cookingTime":"17","totalTime":"20","quantity":"4","ingredients":"\n2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut in cubes\n1 onion, chopped\n3 garlic cloves, minced\n1 small knob fresh ginger, minced\n1+1 tablespoon olive oil\n1 tablespoon Cajun seasoning\n1 1/4 cups chicken broth\n1 cup heavy cream\n2 cups spinach, rinsed and chopped","instructions":"1.

Because they are so thin, they usually only need to be cooked for about 3 minutes. Rinse under cold water upon completion to prevent sticking.\r\nPlace a colander in a large bowl and strain the broth. Set the clean broth aside and separate the chicken from the spices and vegetables (dispose of these, and rinse the chicken if necessary).

Place onto prepared baking sheets then refrigerate for 20-30 minutes to let breading fully adhere - don’t skip this step or breading will fall off. Preheat oven to 425 degrees.\n\nSpray tops of chicken fingers with extra virgin olive oil or nonstick spray then bake for 10 minutes. Flip then spray tops of chicken fingers again with nonstick spray. Place back into the oven, flipping and rotating baking sheets, and then bake for 7-9 more minutes or until chicken fingers are golden brown and cooked through.\n\nMeanwhile combine ingredients for sauce in a small saucepan then bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Lower heat to medium then cook until sauce is reduced and slightly thickened, 5-6 minutes. Pour into a wide bowl then dunk baked chicken fingers into sauce using tongs and place back onto baking sheets.

cup milk (whole, 2%, or skim)\n1/2 cup fine breadcrumbs or ground cornflakes\n1 large egg\n1 teaspoon salt\n1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese\n1/4 cup finely minced Italian parsley\n1 pound ground meat such as beef, pork, turkey, chicken, or veal, or a mix\n1/2 cup finely chopped onion\n1 clove garlic, finely minced","instructions":"Combine the milk and breadcrumbs: Pour the milk over the breadcrumbs in a small bowl and set aside while preparing the rest of the meatball mix. The breadcrumbs will absorb the milk and become soggy.\n\nWhisk the egg, salt, pepper, Parmesan, and parsley: Whisk the egg in a large bowl until blended. Whisk in the salt and a generous quantity of black pepper, then whisk in the Parmesan and parsley.\n\nCombine the egg and ground meat: Add the meat to the egg mixture. Use your hands to thoroughly mix the egg into the ground meat.\n\nAdd the onions and soaked breadcrumbs: Add the onions, garlic, and soaked breadcrumbs to the meat. Mix them thoroughly into the meat with your fingers. Try not to overwork the meat; pinch the meat between your fingers rather than kneading it.\n\nForm the meat into meat balls: Pinch off a piece of the meat mixture and gently roll between your hands to form 1 1/2-inch meatballs. Continue shaping until all the meat is used.\n\nTo roast the meatballs in the oven: Arrange the meatballs spaced slightly apart on a baking sheet. Cook under the broiler for 20 to 25 minutes or bake at 200°C/400°F for 25 to 30 minutes. (Watch closely if cooking meatballs made with lean meat.) The meatballs are done when cooked through and the outsides are browned, and when they register 74°C/165°F in the middle on an instant read thermometer. Serve immediately.\n\nTo cook the meatballs in sauce: Bring a marinara sauce or other pasta sauce to a simmer and add as many meatballs as will fit comfortably in the pan. Cover and simmer for 30 to 35 minutes. The meatballs are done when they're cooked through and register 165°F in the middle on an instant read thermometer. Serve immediately.","pictures":["/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/fr.recettetek/files/images/77f966aa-95b5-4811-a0ee-378f8097dcf5.png"],"url":"http://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-meatballs-cooking-lessons-from-the-kitchn-108048","nutrition":"Per serving, based on 28 servings.

Combine rub ingredients and rub all over tenderloin then place in your Crockpot.\n\nTop with remaining ingredients, cover, and cook on high for 4-6 hours or low for 6-8 hours. When done, the meat will be cooked through and very tender, easily separated with a fork.\n\nRemove the tenderloin from the Crockpot and shred the meat with two forks.
