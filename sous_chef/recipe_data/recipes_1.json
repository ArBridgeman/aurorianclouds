Press the crumbs onto the bottom and about two-thirds of the way up the sides of a 9 inch pie pan. \n\nBake the crust for 5 minutes, then set it aside until you are ready to fill it.\n\nMake the filling and Bake:  In a large mixing bowl combine the cream cheese, 1 cup sugar, and vanilla. Mix with an electric mixer until smooth. Add the pumpkin, eggs, cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice and continue to beat until smooth and creamy.\n\nPour the filling into the pan. Bake for 60 to 70 minutes. The top will turn a bit darker at this point. \n\nRemove from the oven and allow the cheesecake to cool. When the cheesecake has come to room temperature, put it into the refrigerator.

It will also give it a more earthier flavour)\n2-3 lbs pork shoulder (cut into long 3 inch thin strips)\n2 tablespoons honey\nleftover marinade","instructions":"Cutting and Marinating the MeatCut the pork shoulder into thin 3 inch thick strips. (Cooks faster and absorbs marinade more evenly)\n\nCombine the ingredients in the marinade section into a ziplock or a big bowl and combine it with the pork.Marinate it in the fridge for 24 hours.Preparing the GlazeRemove the meat from the marinade and let it sit for an hour in room temperature.\n\nReserve the marinade into a small bowl and remove the garlic bits and gingerAdd 2 tablespoons of honey into the marinade and mix well.(Optional) If you don’t feel comfortable using the marinade that the meat was in, heat it in a small pot for 2-3 minutes on low heat.Set it aside for later, we will use this for glazing at the end of grilling(Option 1) Grilling the Pork on the BBQHeat up BBQ to 325F (162C)Cook the char siu for 15 min on one side, then flip it for another 10 min. Check the meat thermometer. Temperature should be around 145F (62C). If it’s not, keep the meat on longer until it reaches that internal temperature.Once it hits an internal temperature of 145F (62C), we glazed 4-5 times, flipping the meat every minute to prevent burningWhen the meat looks red, sticky and slightly burnt, remove it from the BBQ and let it rest for 20 min on a plate before cutting into it.Once the meat has rested, cut it up and enjoy!! \uD83D\uDE42(Option 2) Cooking the Char Siu in the OvenSet up the meat on the tray or roasting rack and use a rack so there is air flow below the meat. I like it line it with foil before setting down a rack for a easier clean up. If you don’t have a rack, you can take foil and crunch them up into foil balls and rest the meat on that.Set the oven to 400F (204C) and cook it for 20 minutes a side for a total of 40 minutes.For the last 20 minutes, flip and glaze the meat every 3-5 minutes until all the glaze is brushed on. Don’t worry if there are charred sections, it’s a trademark of char siu as well! \uD83D\uDE42Once the meat is done, let it rest for 10-15 minutes, cut it up and enjoy! \uD83D\uDE42NotesCutting the pork up in long thin chunks allows it to cooks faster, and you get more surface area for sauce.The glaze is essentially made with the leftover marinade and additional honey. The additional honey will sweeten up the glaze and thicken it up to give us that nice sticky thick layerUse fancy/cooking molasses and not blackstrap molasses as that is bitter.","pictures":["/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/fr.recettetek/files/images/25d5ea4c-e497-48ec-8038-19a454241442.png"],"url":"http://pupswithchopsticks.com/sweet-sticky-chinese-bbq-pork-aka-char-siu/","nutrition":"NutritionServing Size: 1 ServingCalories: 706 kcalSugar: 17 gSodium: 546 mgFat: 44 gCarbohydrates: 21 gProtein: 59 g","favorite":false,"rating":0.0,"lastModifiedDate":"2020-09-13 14:20:01","uuid":-68010584,"originalPicture":"https://pupswithchopsticks.com/wp-content/uploads/char-siu-done4x1000.jpg","categories":[{"title":"Entree"}],"tags":[{"title":"Asian"},{"title":"Chinese"},{"title":"pork"}],"keywords":"Asian;Chinese;pork"},{"title":"Black Out Cake","preparationTime":"25","cookingTime":"40","inactiveTime":"310","totalTime":"375","quantity":"12","ingredients":"3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) butter, softened\n3 cups sugar\n3 eggs\n3 teaspoons vanilla extract, divided use\n4 oz unsweetened chocolate, melted\n3 cups flour\n3 teaspoons baking soda\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n3/4 cup buttermilk\n1 1/3 cup boiling water\nGanache:\n3 (6 oz.) packages semisweet chocolate chips (3 cups)\n1 1/2 cups heavy cream\n2 tablespoons butter, cut up\n1 teaspoon vanilla\n3/4 cup roasted almonds, diced (for garnish)","instructions":"TO MAKE THE CAKE: \nPreheat oven to 350 degrees.

It’s a twist on the tradition chicken noodle.

Add the onions and saute them for 5 minutes with a tiny pinch of salt so they soften. Add the garlic during the last 30 seconds and let cook until fragrant. Add the diced tomatoes, black beans, green chilies, corn, adobo seasoning, taco seasoning, oregano, chicken broth, water, and enchilada sauce and allow the soup to reach a simmer.\n\nSIMMER: When the soup starts to simmer add the egg noodles, and cooked chicken. Cook the noodles for 2 minutes less than the package directions. You want them to be al-dente. When the noodles are done you can add a little more broth or water if you prefer your soup to be soupier and just let it come back to a simmer. Turn off the heat, stir in the lime zest, juice, and chopped cilantro. Taste and adjust salt and pepper as desired, serve warm.","pictures":["/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/fr.recettetek/files/images/dc51d35f-efdd-437d-9f43-8df124f2290a.png"],"url":"http://littlespicejar.com/mexican-chicken-noodle-soup/","favorite":false,"rating":0.0,"lastModifiedDate":"2020-09-13 14:20:02","uuid":-1200479041,"originalPicture":"http://littlespicejar.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Mexican-Chicken-Noodle-Soup-1.jpg","categories":[{"title":"Entree"},{"title":"Soup"}],"tags":[{"title":"poultry"},{"title":"Mexican"}],"keywords":"poultry"},{"title":"Thai Cashew Chicken","description":"Skinny Thai Cashew Chicken.

Once the oil is hot and shiny, add the chicken mixture and sauté for 4 minutes, just until lightly browned. Add the bell pepper, broccoli, and green onions. Continue sautéing until the chicken is cooked through and the vegetables are crisp-tender, about 5 additional minutes. Stir in the cashews and cook for 30 additional seconds.\n\nWhile the chicken and vegetables are cooking, prepare the sauce. In a small bowl or large measuring cup, stir together the soy sauce, rice vinegar, 2 tablespoons honey, ginger, garlic, and 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes. Taste and add additional honey and/or red pepper flakes as desired (I added an additional 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes). Pour the sauce over the skillet and toss to coat.

So decadent!","preparationTime":"90","cookingTime":"30","totalTime":"120","quantity":"(1) 9\" triple layer cake","ingredients":"[For the chocolate cake] \n2 cups granulated sugar\n1 cup light brown sugar, packed\n2 and 3/4 cups all-purpose flour (not packed!)\n1 and 1/2 cups unsweetened cocoa powder, sifted\n3 teaspoons baking soda\n1 and 1/2 teaspoons baking powder\n1 and 1/4 teaspoons salt\n3 large eggs + 2 large egg yolks, at room temperature\n1 and 1/2 cups full-fat sour cream\n1/3 cup whole milk\n3/4 cup vegetable oil (you may also sub in melted coconut oil)\n2 tablespoons vanilla extract\n1 and 1/2 cups hot water\n\n[For the salted caramel chocolate frosting] \n2 cups unsalted butter (4 sticks, 16 ounces), VERY soft\n4 and 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar, sifted\n3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder, sifted\n1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n3 tablespoons heavy cream (more if needed)\n2 tablespoons salted caramel sauce\nGarnish:\n1 and 1/4 cups salted caramel sauce (please see post for more on this)\nFlaky sea salt","instructions":"For the chocolate cake:\n\nPreheat oven to 350°(F). Cut out three 9-inch round segments of parchment paper to line your cake pans with. Spray each pan generously - sides and bottom - with nonstick cooking spray, then place the parchment paper cut out in the bottom of the pans and spray again. It's important to make sure every bit of pan and paper are sprayed so your cakes don't get stuck. Set pans aside.\n\nIn the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, or in a large bowl using a handheld electric mixer, combine both sugars, flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder and salt; mix on low until dry ingredients are thoroughly combined. Use your hands to break up any large clumps, if needed. In a separate bowl combine the eggs, egg yolks, sour cream, milk, oil and vanilla extract; mix until completely combined. Pour mixture into the dry ingredients and beat on low until just incorporated. Pour in hot water and continue mixing until completely combined; about 1 minute. The batter will quite thin.\n\nDivide batter evenly among prepared pans. Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes, or until a wooden toothpick or cake tester inserted in the center of a cake comes out clean or with just a few moist crumbs attached. Cool cakes for 10 minutes in the pan before removing from pans and transferring to a cooling rack; cool cakes completely before frosting.\n\nFor the chocolate frosting:\n\nIn a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the softened butter on medium-speed until completely smooth; about 3 minutes. Turn the mixer off and sift the powdered sugar and cocoa into the mixing bowl. Turn the mixer on the lowest speed and mix until the sugar/cocoa have been absorbed by the butter; about 2 minutes. Increase mixer speed to medium; add in vanilla extract, salt, heavy cream and salted caramel; beat for 3 minutes. If your frosting appears a little too thin, add a little more confectioners' sugar; If your frosting needs to be thinner, add additional heavy cream, 1 tablespoon at a time.\n\nAssembly:\n\nUsing a serrated knife, carefully trim the raised top of each cake, making each one an even, level surface. Transfer 1 layer to a large plate or cake stand. Spread a thin layer of frosting on top, then add a 1/2 cup of caramel; top with another cake layer, and repeat, thinly spread it with a layer of frosting, then adding a 1/2 cup of caramel. Top final cake layer and place cake in the fridge to set for 1 hour. Once set, finishing frosting the top and sides of the cake. Sprinkle with sea salt. Slice and serve, or keep refrigerated for up to 5 days.","pictures":["/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/fr.recettetek/files/images/02634843-90aa-4ba7-84d3-22a31387872f.png"],"url":"http://bakerbynature.com/salted-caramel-chocolate-cake/","nutrition":"Serving Size: 1 slice","favorite":false,"rating":4.0,"lastModifiedDate":"2020-09-13 14:20:02","uuid":1886879760,"originalPicture":"http://bakerbynature.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/untitled-45-of-197-1.jpg","categories":[{"title":"Dessert"}],"tags":[{"title":"Ariel"}],"keywords":"Ariel"},{"title":"Chicken Scampi","preparationTime":"20 min","cookingTime":"40 min","totalTime":"60","quantity":"6 servings","ingredients":"3 tbs butter\r\n2 tbs minced onions dried or fresh\r\n1 tsp heaping minced garlic\r\n1 1/2 cups chicken broth\r\n1/2 tsp Italian seasoning\r\n1/2 tsp fine sea salt\r\n1/2 tsp black pepper\r\n1/2 tsp red pepper flakes\r\n1 tbs dried parsley\r\n1 cup heavy cream\r\n16 oz angel hair pasta\r\n1 lb chicken tenderloins about 9-12 pieces\r\nsalt and pepper\r\n1 cup flour\r\n4 tbs olive oil\r\n2 red bell peppers\r\n1 red onions\r\nfreshly grated Parmesan cheese for garnish","instructions":"In a medium sized sauce pan add butter, minced onion, minced garlic and saute over medium heat for a 1-2 minutes.

Stir in the tomato pesto.\nTransfer to serving bowl. Top each bowl with a few basil leaves and toasted pine nuts. Enjoy with your favorite crusty bread!\nNotes\nCook’s Tip: This soup is great to serve a crowd or for meal prep. To store leftovers, use glass containers with a tight lid and refrigerate for 2 to 3 days. You can also freeze cooked bean soup in portions. Thaw overnight in the fridge and heat stovetop over medium heat, stirring often.\nCook’s Tip for Using Dry Beans: You can make this bean salad using dry beans. Budget enough time to start at the least the night before you need to make the bean soup recipe.To make this bean soup with dry beans, you will start with 3/4 cups dry beans in place of each 15-ounce can of beans. You must soak each kind of beans in a large bowl with plenty of water (water to cover the beans by 3 inches.) They will nearly triple in size while soaking. Discard soaking water before cooking.\nCook each kind of beans separately. In a cooking pot, add beans and cover with water by 2 inches.  Bring to a boil, skim off and discard any foam on the surface. Reduce heat, cover and simmer gently, stirring occasionally, until beans are tender, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.\nDrain any cooking water and proceed with the bean soup recipe as written. You can also store the cooked beans in the fridge in a tight-lid glass container for 2 days or before making the bean soup (keep in mind, this changes how long you can eat the leftovers if refrigerated. But you can certainly still freeze and use at a later time.)\n ","pictures":["/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/fr.recettetek/files/images/19705fba-5bd1-473d-8be1-b11e57aff5b9.png"],"url":"https://www.themediterraneandish.com/three-bean-soup-tomato-pesto/","favorite":false,"rating":0.0,"lastModifiedDate":"2020-09-13 14:20:03","uuid":59055142,"originalPicture":"https://www.themediterraneandish.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Mediterranean-Bean-Soup-Recipe-The-Mediterranean-Dish-4.jpg","categories":[{"title":"Entree"},{"title":"Soup"}],"tags":[{"title":"plant protein"},{"title":"vegetarian"},{"title":"Mediterranean"}],"keywords":"plant protein;vegetarian"},{"title":"Szechuan shrimp and broccoli","description":"NEED TO IMPROVE/INCREASE SAUCE (was nonexistent).

Whatever the classification, Pad See Ew is always a favorite among family and guests","preparationTime":"10 min","cookingTime":"10 min","totalTime":"20","quantity":"2 to 3 servings","ingredients":"8 ounces flank steak, sliced into ⅛-inch thick slices\n1 teaspoon Thai black soy sauce (Thai soy sauce is saltier than Chinese brands)\n1 teaspoon vegetable oil\n1 teaspoon cornstarch or tapioca starch\n1 tablespoon oyster sauce\n½ teaspoon sugar\n2 teaspoons Thai soy sauce or regular soy sauce\n1 tablespoon Thai black soy sauce\n1 teaspoon fish sauce\nFreshly ground white pepper, to taste\n1 pound fresh wide rice noodles (you can also use dried rice noodles)\n4 tablespoons vegetable oil\n3 cloves garlic, sliced thinly\n3 cups of Chinese broccoli, cut into 2-inch pieces\n2 large eggs, slightly beaten","instructions":"To the flank steak, add the Thai black soy sauce, vegetable oil, and cornstarch, and mix until the beef is completely coated. Set aside.\n\nFor the rest of the dish, combine the oyster sauce, sugar, Thai soy sauce, Thai black soy sauce, fish sauce, and white pepper in a small bowl. Stir to mix well.\n\nMake sure your fresh rice noodles are at room temperature. If the noodles are really cold and stiff from refrigeration, rinse them quickly under hot tap water when you are ready to stir-fry the dish. This extra step will help you avoid a big homogenous lump of noodles during stir-frying. Be sure to shake off any excess water after rinsing and use them immediately.\n\nThe fresh wide rice noodles really set this dish apart from other noodle dishes, so try your best to find them. Or you can use our recipe for homemade rice noodles to make them at home. If either of these options don’t work, then use dried rice noodles. If using a dried rice noodle, follow the directions on the package and make sure you undercook the noodles slightly (al dente), since you will be cooking them again in the wok. After you drain the noodles thoroughly, toss the noodles with a tablespoon of oil. This will prevent them from sticking to the wok.\n\nHeat your wok over high heat until it just starts to smoke, and spread 1 tablespoon of oil around the perimeter of the wok evenly to coat. Sear the beef until it is 80% cooked through, and transfer back to the marinade bowl.\n\nAdd another tablespoon of oil to the wok and stir in the garlic. Immediately add the Chinese broccoli and stir-fry for 20 seconds (stir constantly to prevent the garlic from burning).\n\nNext, spread the noodles around the wok. Continue to work quickly--your wok should be at the highest heat setting. Spread the sauce mixture over the top of the noodles, and gently mix everything with your wok spatula using a scooping motion for about 20 seconds. Add the beef back to wok.\n\nPush the mixture to one side to let the empty side of the wok heat for 10 seconds. Add another tablespoon of oil to the wok, and add the beaten eggs. Wait 5 seconds for them to begin to cook. Scramble the eggs for another few seconds, breaking them up into smaller pieces.\n\nIf your wok is not sizzling at this point, it probably means that your burner is not hot enough. Be patient, and the heat should “catch up.” Stir-fry the mixture just enough so the noodles heat up evenly, but don’t break into small pieces. Make sure you use your wok spatula to scrape the bottom of the wok so the noodles don’t stick.\n\nAs the wok heats up, you will notice that the food will stick to it less readily! But if you need to, you can add a little oil to make it easier to stir-fry.\n\nContinue cooking, stirring less frequently (so the noodles get slightly caramelized, creating that restaurant-style flavor) for another 1 to 2 minutes, or until the noodles are heated through. Serve hot with Homemade Chili Oil or Chiu Chow Sauce on the side!","pictures":["/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/fr.recettetek/files/images/079eb7e5-ad22-4fda-995a-72ed6f7e3c18.png"],"url":"http://thewoksoflife.com/2017/02/pad-see-ew/","favorite":false,"rating":0.0,"lastModifiedDate":"2020-09-13 14:20:03","uuid":1091392977,"originalPicture":"https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/pad-see-ew-11.jpg","categories":[{"title":"Entree"}],"tags":[{"title":"Asian"},{"title":"beef"},{"title":"Thai"}],"keywords":"Asian;beef;Thai"},{"title":"Warm spinach dip","preparationTime":"3","cookingTime":"3","totalTime":"6","quantity":"2","ingredients":"3/4 cup cashews \n3/4 cup water \n1/4 cup chickpeas or white beans \n3-4 tbsp nutritional yeast \n1/4 tsp garlic powder\n1/4 tsp onion powder \nDash of salt and pepper \n2 tsp lemon juice \n2 handfuls of spinach,  chopped ","instructions":"Blend everything (except spinach) together. \nSautee spinach in medium pan with a small amount of oil. \n\nOnce spinach is wilted a little, add blended mixture.

In a separate bowl, mix together the egg and 1/2 cup water.\n\nOne at a time, assemble the wontons: Place approximately 1/2 teaspoon of the cream cheese mixture on one corner of a wonton wrapper. Use your finger to \"paint\" the egg wash all around the edges of the wrapper. Roll the wrapper on a diagonal, starting with the cream cheese corner and stopping when half the wrapper is rolled and the cream cheese mixture is inside. Bring up the 2 ends and use the egg wash to stick them together. Allow the remaining pointed end to naturally tuck backward. (The wontons should resemble tortellini.) As you work, place the assembled wontons under plastic wrap or a light towel to keep them from drying out.\n\nHeat 2 to 3 inches of vegetable oil in a large saucepan or medium skillet until a deep-fry thermometer inserted in the oil registers just under 350 degrees F. (You don't want the oil too hot or it will burn the wontons! Experiment with a spare sheet of wonton wrappers to check.)\n\nIn batches of 4 or 5 at a time, fry the wontons for 45 seconds to 1 minute, flipping carefully midway through to make sure they brown evenly. Remove them when you think they still could stand to slightly brown a teeny bit more (because they will slightly brown in the seconds after you remove them from the pan!). Drain the wontons on a paper towel. Repeat with the remaining batches.\n\nIt's best to wait 5 to 10 minutes before serving the wontons, as the cream cheese filling can be quite hot. Serve with the dipping sauce.","pictures":["/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/fr.recettetek/files/images/4b158e00-80b4-45a3-a76e-384e9ed0aba7.png"],"url":"http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/ree-drummond/cream-cheese-wontons.html","favorite":false,"rating":4.0,"lastModifiedDate":"2020-09-13 14:20:03","uuid":-326588433,"originalPicture":"http://foodnetwork.sndimg.com/content/dam/images/food/fullset/2015/8/26/3/WU0802H_Cream-Cheese-Wontons_s4x3.jpg.rend.sniipadlarge.jpeg","categories":[{"title":"Entree"},{"title":"Side"}],"tags":[{"title":"vegetarian"},{"title":"Asian"},{"title":"milk protein"},{"title":"Alex"}],"keywords":"vegetarian;Asian;milk protein;Alex"},{"title":"Chicken fajita soup","preparationTime":"10 min","cookingTime":"40 min","totalTime":"50","quantity":"3 servings","ingredients":"1 pound chicken breasts\r\n1 teaspoon olive oil\r\n2 bell peppers, seeded and chopped\r\n1 red onion, peeled and chopped\r\n4 garlic cloves, minced\r\n15 ounce can black beans drained\r\n15 ounce can fire roasted diced tomatoes\r\n8 cups chicken broth\r\n1 fajita seasoning packet\r\n1/2 cup brown rice, optional\r\nPossible Garnishes: Reduced Fat Cheese, Scallions, Avocado","instructions":"Place a large sauce 6-8 quart pot over medium heat.

Set the pressure on “high” and set the timer for 15 to 20 minutes for soaked beans, or 35 to 40 minutes for dried beans. Use less time if you want the beans to be intact and a bit chewy or use more time if you want the beans to become super soft and create a stewy texture.\n\nOnce done cooking, let rest for at least 15 minutes to release the pressure naturally. Then you can use the quick release by pressing the quick release button or using a spatula to move the valve to “unlock”.\n\nNow the beans are ready to eat. You can store them in a sealed container in the fridge for 5 days or in the freezer for 2 months.","pictures":["/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/fr.recettetek/files/images/ea3083ba-7527-4fb2-8dfd-124ac3721a3a.png"],"url":"https://omnivorescookbook.com/instant-pot-black-beans/","favorite":false,"rating":0.0,"lastModifiedDate":"2020-09-13 14:20:04","uuid":-1679709884,"originalPicture":"https://omnivorescookbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/2002_Instant-Pot-Black-Beans_550.jpg","categories":[{"title":"Entree"},{"title":"Side"}],"tags":[{"title":"plant protein"},{"title":"veggies"},{"title":"Asian"},{"title":"vegan"},{"title":"Chinese"}],"keywords":"plant protein;veggies;Asian;vegan;Chinese"},{"title":"Choy Sum with Garlic Sauce","description":"A super simple Choy Sum recipe that uses 5 ingredients to create a scrumptious side dish in 15 minutes.

Heat over medium-low heat, stirring regularly, until smoking.\n\nRemove the pan from the heat and add the granulated garlic. Transfer everything into a spice grinder or a small food processor. Grind until everything turns into a granulated spice mix.\n\nCombine the shaoxing wine and sesame oil in a small bowl. Stir well.\n\nTransfer the chicken into a large bowl. Rub the chicken with the sesame oil mixture on the inside and outside until well coated.\n\nSprinkle the Sichuan peppercorn salt mixture onto the inside and outside of the chicken. Gently pat and rub with your hands until evenly coated.\n\nStuff the cavity with green onions and ginger. Seal with the garlic, with the cut side facing the inside of the chicken. Secure the stuffing by stitching together the cavity with a toothpick (skip this if you don’t have a toothpick). Tuck the wing tips underneath the breasts to prevent burning.\n\nPlace the chicken breast-side-down in the same large bowl. Cover with plastic wrap. Let it marinate overnight in the fridge. Rotate once halfway through marinating (it’s OK if you forget the rotating).\n\nRoast the chicken\n\nAdjust the oven rack, so the chicken will be positioned in the middle of the oven. Preheat the oven to 450 °F (232 °C). Line a roasting pan with foil for easy cleaning. Pour in a cup of water to prevent the drippings from burning. Place a roasting rack into the pan.\n\nOption 1 - Fussless roasting\n\nDrizzle the extra marinating liquid onto the chicken. Roast the chicken at 450 °F (232 °C) for 30 minutes.\n\nTake the chicken out of the oven. Turn the oven to 350 °F (176 °C). Drizzle additional sesame oil onto the chicken. Add more water to the pan if needed.\n\nReturn the chicken back to the oven. Roast at 350 °F (176 °C) for another 30 minutes, or until the juices run clear.\n\nOption 2 - Extra crispy thigh\n\nIf you happen to have an adjustable roasting rack, you can use this method to get extra crispy thighs. Start the roasting by shaping the roasting rack into a “V” shape. Grease the rack with a thin layer of oil to prevent sticking. Place the chicken on its side, so the thigh and the wing are facing up. Drizzle a few teaspoons of the marinating liquid onto the chicken. Roast at 450 °F (232 °C) for 15 to 20 minutes, until the top of the thigh turns golden brown.\n\nTake the chicken out of the oven. Wearing a pair of oven mitts and holding both ends of the chicken, flip it so the other thigh and wing face up. Drizzle the rest of the marinating liquid onto the chicken. Continue to roast at 450 °F (232 °C) for 10 to 15 minutes, until the top of the thigh turns golden brown.\n\nTake the chicken out of the oven. Turn the oven to 350 °F (176 °C). Drizzle additional sesame oil onto the chicken. Add more water to the pan if needed.\n\nReturn the chicken to the oven. Roast at 350 °F (176 °C) for another 30 minutes, or until the juices run clear.\n\nTest doneness and rest\n\nFor a smaller chicken (under 4 lbs / 1.8 kg), I would test the chicken at the 20-minute mark, just in case, to avoid overcooking. For a bigger chicken, you might need 10 minutes or more of additional roasting time at 350 °F (176 °C) to finish.\n\nFor a more accurate reading, use an instant-read thermometer, inserted into the thickest part of the thigh and breast. The thigh should read at least 160 °F (71 °C) and the breast at least 155 °F (68 °C). While resting, the temperature of the dark meat will continue to go up and should reach 165 °F (74 °C), the safe temperature recommended by the FDA. Note, I prefer to cook chicken breast slightly under 165 °F (74 °C), which yields super juicy and tender results.\n\nLet the chicken rest for at least 10 minutes before serving. It will stay pretty hot for about 30 minutes.\n\n(Optional) Bonus - chicken rice\n\nCollect the pan drippings in a measuring cup. Add water to the drippings to reach the needed amount of liquid, depending on the type of rice you’ll make. You will need 1 3/4 cup of liquid for jasmine rice, or 1 1/4 cup of rice for medium or long grain rice. Check out my rice cooking guide for more information.\n\nAdd the rice into a small saucepan. Add water to cover. Rinse in a circular motion with your fingers a few times. Drain the water and repeat the process one more time. Drain the water thoroughly.\n\nAdd the pan dripping water mixture, ginger, and a pinch of salt.\n\nCook over medium heat until the water comes to a full boil. Cover the pan and turn to low heat immediately. Steam 15 minutes for jasmine and long grain rice, and 18 minutes for medium grain rice. Do not uncover the pot during steaming.\n\nOnce the rice is done cooking, remove the pan from the stove.

Add half the marinade into the cavity of the chicken. Pour the rest of the marinade onto the chicken skin. Seal the bag halfway across. Try to squeeze out as much air as possible. Seal the bag. Rub chicken through the bag to make sure the marinade and herbs are evenly dispersed.\n\nPlace chicken in fridge for 24 to 48 hours (*footnote). Flip once during marinating.\n\nOn the day of cooking, place a cooling/roasting rack over a baking sheet.\n\nTransfer the chicken from the bag to a large plate. Discard marinating liquid and all the herbs. Make sure the cavity of the chicken isn’t holding any liquid. Place the chicken onto the roasting rack, breast side up.\n\nPlace the baking sheet near an AC vent or in front of a fan. Let the bird air dry completely. It will take at least 4 hours if you don’t use a fan. To speed up the process, I sometimes use a hair dryer to dry the chicken. You can also place the chicken in the fridge to dry, but it takes longer.\n\nThe surface of the chicken must be completely dry in order to yield crispy skin after baking. When the chicken is ready to bake, the surface won’t be shiny, with almost a leathery feel when touched.\n\nPreheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 C).\n\nLine the baking sheet with aluminum foil to catch the chicken grease. Place the roasting rack on top. Spray a thin layer of oil onto the roasting rack. (*see footnote 2)\n\nTie chicken legs together with kitchen twine. Spray a thin layer of oil onto another sheet of aluminum foil. Cut foil into small squares and wrap around the end of the chicken legs and wings tips. (*see footnote 3)\n\nBake on the lowest rack in the oven for 30 minutes. Rotate chicken (don’t flip). Bake for another 30 minutes. Rotate again. Continue baking until the thermometer reads 165 F (74C) when probing into the thickest part of the leg. It takes me 1 hour and 30 minutes in total to roast a chicken from Costco (about 5 pounds).\n\nDuring the final hour of baking, check on the chicken every 10 to 20 minutes. When you notice that any part of the chicken is already browned, cover that part with aluminum foil to prevent it from burning. If you think this is too much trouble, you can simply cover the whole chicken with a large piece of foil when most parts are nicely browned.\n\nWhen the chicken is cooked through, let cool for 15 minutes before slicing.\n\nServe chicken by itself as a main. Or you can serve it with sriracha, plum sauce, or soy sauce.\n\nTo reheat leftover chicken, my favorite way is to cook it with a bit of oil on the stove top. The chicken will get nicely charred and heat up in a few minutes without drying out (which happens if you reheat it in the oven).","pictures":["/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/fr.recettetek/files/images/0dfdcdf7-36f4-4a4d-b218-233415f452f2.png"],"url":"https://omnivorescookbook.com/cantonese-roast-chicken/","favorite":false,"rating":0.0,"lastModifiedDate":"2020-09-13 14:20:04","uuid":-129912195,"originalPicture":"https://omnivorescookbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/1510_Perfect-Chinese-Roast-Chicken_002.jpg","categories":[{"title":"Entree"}],"tags":[{"title":"Asian"},{"title":"poultry"},{"title":"Chinese"}],"keywords":"Asian;poultry;Chinese"},{"title":"Sichuan Mala Chicken (辣子鸡, La Zi Ji)","description":"Slightly adapted from Chongqing Chicken With Chilies (La Zi Ji) by The Mala Project.","preparationTime":"15","cookingTime":"5","inactiveTime":"15","totalTime":"35","quantity":"2 servings","ingredients":"450 g chicken breast, cut into 1-inch cubes\n\n[MARINADE]\n6 tbsp Shaoxing wine\n3 tbsp water\n3 tbsp soy sauce\n\n[BREADING]\n0.5 cup cornstarch\n3 tsp cayenne powder\n3 tsp ground, toasted Sichuan peppercorns\n1 tsp sea salt\n\n[SPICE]\n5 garlic cloves, thinly sliced\n1 tbsp ginger, grated\n4 green onions, roughly chopped\n2 tbsp sesame seeds\n2 whole dried red Sichuan chilies \n2 tbsp Sichuan chili flakes\n1.5 tbsp cornstarch\n2 tsp Sichuan peppercorns\n1 tsp sugar","instructions":"[MARINATE]\nCombine chicken and marinade in a bowl.

Remove the chicken fat from the cavity and set it aside for making the rice.\n\nPlace the whole chicken breast-side-up in a 5-quart pot or one that’s deep and wide enough to hold the chicken. Add water until it covers the chicken (about 8 cups of water in my case). Bring the water to a boil over medium-high heat. Gently move the chicken with a spatula so it does not stick to the bottom. Skim the foam with a fine mesh strainer until the soup becomes clear, 5 minutes or so.\n\nTurn to medium-low heat. Add the ginger, green onion, and salt. Carefully flip the chicken using a spatula and a pair of tongs. Simmer for 10 minutes. Flip the chicken again so the breast side is up. Continue to simmer until the chicken is just cooked through, 15 to 20 minutes, depending on the size of your chicken. Test the doneness by poking the joint between the thigh and the body with a paring knife. The chicken is cooked if the juice comes out clear. Or you can use a thermometer inserted into the same joint. It should register 165 degrees F (74 C).\n\nPrepare a large ice bath when the chicken is almost done.\n\nWhen the chicken is done, immediately remove it from the pot and plunge it into the ice bath to cool. This process will tighten the chicken skin and stop the cooking process to keep the meat tender. Once the chicken is mostly cooled, 3 to 4 minutes, drain and pat it dry with paper towels. Transfer to a cutting board to air dry.\n\nStrain and save the chicken broth for cooking the rice and making chicken soup.\n\nRice\n\nWhile the chicken is cooling, prepare the rice. Heat the reserved chicken fat in a non-stick skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir occasionally, until the oil renders. You should have about 2 tablespoons of oil in your pan. If there isn’t enough chicken fat, add some butter to the pan (I used 1 tablespoon of butter).\n\nAdd the ginger, garlic, and green onion to the skillet. Cook and stir until fragrant, 1 minute or so. Add the rice and continue stirring until the rice turns pale yellow, 3 to 4 minutes. Turn to medium-low heat. Transfer 3 cups of chicken broth from the big pot you used to cook the chicken to the rice skillet. Cook, covered, for 12 minutes. Then remove the pan from the stove. Let rest, covered for another 10 minutes. Fluff the rice with a spatula. Taste the rice. Add a bit more salt, if needed, and mix well.\n\nSauce\n\nWhile cooking the rice, prepare the chicken and the sauce(s). Separate the chicken into legs, breasts, and wings.\n\nPrepare chili dipping sauce: add all the ingredients into a mini-food processor or the chopping container included with your immersion blender. Chop everything into a coarse paste.\n\nServing\n\nThere are two ways to prepare the chicken for serving. You can rub either sesame oil or sweet soy sauce onto the skin. Read more about the two options in the blog post above. Once done, slice the chicken breast into bite-sized pieces.

The oil will drain to the bottom and you can then transfer the beef to a sheet pan or plate. No need for paper towels or wire racks!  \n\nAfter frying the beef, leave about 2 tablespoons of the oil in the wok, and remove any excess. If your wok got burned in the frying process, this is a good time to wash it. While you want the beef flavor from frying, you definitely don’t want burned bits in the stir-fry if you got carried away with the heat during frying.\n\nAssembling the stir-fry:\n\nSet the wok over medium heat.

Let them toast in the oil for 20 seconds. (If you want your dish spicier, add the dried chili peppers earlier, along with the shallots.)\n\nNext, pour the Shaoxing wine around the perimeter of the wok. Add the sliced garlic, fermented black beans, and the red Holland or Fresno peppers. Stir-fry for another 30 to 60 seconds on high heat.\n\nNext, add the fried beef and pour over the pre-prepared sauce.

Remove the eggplant from the oven, and carefully stir the eggplant into the simmering tomato sauce.\n\nLet the squash and bell pepper pan continue to bake until the peppers are caramelized, about 5 to 10 more minutes. Then, transfer the contents of the pan into the simmering sauce. Continue simmering for 5 more minutes to give the flavors time to meld.\n\nRemove the pot from the heat. Stir in 1 teaspoon olive oil, the fresh basil and red pepper flakes. Crumble the dried oregano between your fingers as you drop it into the pot. Season to taste with additional salt (I usually add 1/4 teaspoon more) and black pepper.\n\nServe in bowls, perhaps with a little drizzle of olive oil, additional chopped basil, or black pepper on top (all optional). Like all stews, this ratatouille’s flavor improves as it cools. It’s even better reheated the next day. Ratatouille keeps well in the refrigerator, covered, for 4 days, or for several months in the freezer.","pictures":["/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/fr.recettetek/files/images/79327d59-a878-4dc8-b0e6-ea08e676cf4d.png"],"url":"https://cookieandkate.com/best-ratatouille-recipe/","favorite":false,"rating":0.0,"lastModifiedDate":"2020-09-13 14:20:04","uuid":-180352690,"originalPicture":"https://cookieandkate.com/images/2019/09/best-ratatouille-recipe-1-1-225x225.jpg","categories":[{"title":"Entree"},{"title":"Side"}],"tags":[{"title":"veggies"},{"title":"vegan"},{"title":"French"}],"keywords":"veggies;vegan;French"},{"title":"Cheesy Lentil Bolognese Casserole","description":"Our family is in love with this cheesy, creamy, and hearty casserole!

Divine! Here are some time-saving tips: if you’re looking for a head-start on meal prep, the cheese sauce can be made a couple days in advance and refrigerated in an airtight container. You can also prepare the entire casserole in advance: simply follow the recipe through step #9 (stop before baking!), wrap it up, refrigerate, and then cook as-is one to two days later as directed in step #10.

One of the most popular dishes from my cook book Indian Kitchen was the Hyderabadi green chicken masala. Apart from the inclusion of coriander & mint making it such a stand out dish I also use cashew nuts which lend a lovely richness and creamy flavour to the curry. Blended cashew nut paste is commonly used in India cooking and especially when you are looking to get that smooth creamy consistency yet lending some richness to the dish. A blended paste like this is great to thicken sauces too.\nA few years back I attended a family wedding in Hyderabad and the green chicken curry was the recipe my friend’s mother so kindly shared with me. That evening, I was invited to an Indian feast at their home where she cooked a korma. I was curious to find out if all kormas were painstakingly lengthy recipes and if they took forever to make. She disagreed and cited her method of cooking as easy as it could get, to give it a creamy delicious gravy. And I agree her recipe which she inherited from her mother in law, is a classic example of how simple it can be with amazing flavours. While she was talking me through how she had made it, I wrote it all down on a scrappy piece of paper. I remember rushing to write it just so I wouldn’t forget the little tips she gave to cook the korma. Looking through my notes recently I found that little piece of paper and here’s the result. A really easy yet scrummy korma which I savoured during the meal years ago in Hyderabad and still remember fondly.\nThis Murgh Kaju ka Korma is flavoured with whole spices including cardamom, cloves and bay leaves which give it the required warmth alongside chilli for the heat. I’d cook this recipe when I want to impress my guests with a delicious korma.

If using large potatoes, then cube them to equal size about 1½ inch each. If using baby potatoes make sure all are of the same size.\n\nBring 3 to 4 cups of water to a rolling boil in a pot. Then add the potatoes. Boil them until they are half cooked. To check, prick them with a fork, you will feel them hard but not very hard. Remove them from water with a slotted spoon. Set aside to cool & dry.\n\nThis step is optional but gives a good texture to the potatoes. Heat 3 tablespoons of oil in a non-stick pan. Add the potatoes and shallow fry them on a medium high flame until golden. Remove them to a plate.\n\nPrick each aloo with a fork 3 times so it absorbs the flavors of the gravy. Ensure you don't overdo this and break them.\n\nBring 2 cups of water to a boil and add onions to it. Boil for 6 to 8 minutes until they turn pale and transparent. Drain them completely & rinse with cold water. Drain again.\n\nAdd them to a blender jar along with cashews and tomatoes. Make a smooth puree. If you do not have a powerful blender, then filter the puree. Keep this aside.\n\nMaking dum aloo recipe\n\nHeat a pan with 2 tablespoons oil. Add bay leaf and cardamom. Then add ginger garlic paste & fry until the raw smell goes away.\n\nAdd the onion tomato paste and saute until the raw smell goes away and the paste thickens slightly.\n\nNext add chili powder, garam masala, coriander powder, salt, fennel seeds powder, sugar and turmeric.\n\nSaute until the masala becomes thick, smells good and aromatic. (check step-by-step photos above)\n\nMeanwhile, whisk yogurt in a small bowl until smooth. Then add 2 tablespoons of the onion tomato masala to the whisked yogurt. Mix it well and add back to the pan.\n\nSaute until the masala turns thicker. Add potatoes and pour ½ cup water. Stir well to make a gravy. If needed add more water as required. Bring the gravy to a boil.\n\nCover with a tight lid or foil. Dum cook on a low heat for 5 to 7 minutes. At this stage the gravy must be thick and potatoes fully cooked.\n\nSprinkle crushed kasuri methi. Taste test and add more salt if needed. Turn off.\n\nLastly sprinkle coriander leaves and transfer dum aloo to a serving bowl. Keep covered until dum aloo is served.\n\nServe it with basmati rice, roti, butter naan or even with flavored rice like jeera rice, ghee rice or pulao.\n\nInstant pot Instructions\n\nBring 1 ½ cups water to a rolling boil in a small pot. Add the cubed onions and boil them for 6 to 8 min, until transparent. Drain them completely and rinse with cold water. Drain again.\n\nAdd these to a blender jar along with tomatoes & cashews. Blend to a smooth puree.\n\nPeel and dice the potatoes to 1 ½ inch pieces & keep them in water.\n\nPress the SAUTE button on the Instant pot and pour oil to the steel insert.\n\nAdd bay leaf and green cardamoms to the hot oil. Followed by ginger garlic paste.\n\nSaute for 30 to 60 seconds until the raw smell goes away.\n\nThen add the onion tomato paste, red chilli powder, garam masala, coriander powder, salt, sugar and fennel powder.\n\nSaute for 3 to 4 until the mixture turns slightly thicker.\n\nWhile this is done, whisk yogurt in a small bowl until smooth. Take 2 tablespoons of the onion tomato masala to the yogurt and mix it well. Pour it back to the pot.\n\nMix everything well and saute for another 3 to 4 minutes. The mixture turns very aromatic and you will get the caramelized smell. The raw smell of tomatoes has to go away by then. Do not burn. Press CANCEL button.\n\nPour 1 ¾ cups water and deglaze the pot with a wooden spatula to release the bits of masala stuck at the bottom. Do not skip this step.\n\nDrain the water from diced potatoes and add them here. Taste test the gravy and add more salt if needed.\n\nSecure the Instant pot with the lid and position the steam release value to sealing. Press PRESSURE COOK button and set the timer to 4 minutes.\n\nThe IP beeps when it is done. Wait for 6 to 7 minutes and then release the pressure manually by gently moving the steam release handle to venting.\n\nYou see the dum aloo gravy is almost thick yet slightly runny. The potatoes also will be perfectly done. Crush kasuri methi and add it.\n\nPress SAUTE button and let it cook for 30 to 60 seconds. The gravy will thicken further after cooling.\n\nGarnish with coriander leaves and serve with naan or plain basmati rice.","pictures":["/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/fr.recettetek/files/images/b6db88ad-9f45-46c5-bd3a-2ceb7cf5c7ac.png"],"url":"https://www.indianhealthyrecipes.com/dum-aloo-recipe/","favorite":false,"rating":0.0,"lastModifiedDate":"2020-09-13 14:20:04","uuid":1183096328,"originalPicture":"https://www.indianhealthyrecipes.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/dum-aloo.jpg","categories":[{"title":"Side"}],"tags":[{"title":"veggies"},{"title":"Asian"},{"title":"vegan"},{"title":"Indian"}],"keywords":"veggies;Asian;vegan;Indian;Indian"},{"title":"Chicken vindaloo","description":"A hot, spicy & flavorful dish made by marinating and simmering chicken in a spice paste.

A bowl of warm dal, rice topped with ghee is comfort food and even makes a perfect accompaniment to any meal. But when we think of slow cooked creamy Dal Makhani it’s in a league of its own. A traditional lentil dish that’s part of most Indian meals at weddings and special occasions. Essentially a recipe hailing from the north of India with influences from the Peshawar Punjabi community after partition, it now sits well in Mughlai/ north Indian restaurant menus across India and worldwide.\nMost commonly used lentils in Indian cooking include toor dal, channa dal and moong dal amongst others. There are over 50 varieties but one that’s key to a classic Dal Makhani is urad dal also known as black lentils.\nMy recipe is one I’ve adapted from a family recipe during my travels to Amritsar 11 years ago. Using tomatoes instead of yoghurt for a rich tangy flavour is the base of this recipe although I also add a little bit of tomato puree to thicken the dal and add richness that you are looking for in a restaurant style Dal Makhani.\nThere are loads of recipes for a slow cooked black dal that include only urad dal without including any other lentil or pulses in addition to it. Urad dal is a lentil that thrives on slow cooking; the longer it cooks the richer the Dal Makhani is. In places like Bukhara (ITC Delhi) synonymous for its Dal Bukhara, a master pot is cooked low and slow overnight. Although in this day and age we don’t have the luxury of cooking over coals or even simmering the dal for half a day! So the addition of a small quantity or Rajma/ Kidney beans will give the makhani gravy its rich texture and also a little bit of colour. Both the Kidney beans and urad dal cook with ginger, tomatoes and chilli giving it plenty of time and injecting lots of flavour.\nThe reason I say this dish is for special occasions is the copious quantities of butter and cream. No recipe should skimp on it and nor will mine! But where a restaurant in Delhi might opt for a kilo of butter to cook Dal Makhani I’ve gone with a few tablespoons!\nNOTE- Lots of readers recently have mentioned cooking my recipes in a pressure cooker. This Dal Makhani can also be cooked in a pressure cooker to save time. I have a conventional pressure cooker which take around 8-10 whistles over a medium flame to cook the dal and rajma until its soft. Then proceed to frying the remaining ingredients.","preparationTime":"15","cookingTime":"40","totalTime":"55","quantity":"serves 4","ingredients":"280gms whole urad dal (black lentil)\n60gms red kidney beans\n1.5 litres water\n3 tbsp vegetable oil\nPinch of asafoetida\n1 green chilli slit lengthwise\n1 tsp cumin seeds coarsely ground\n10 cloves of garlic finely chopped\n210gms white onion finely chopped\n220gms tomatoes finely chopped\n3 tbsp tomato puree\n1” piece of ginger finely chopped\n1 tsp mild chilli powder\n½ tsp garam masala powder\n2 tbsp butter\n60mls single cream\n1 tbsp chopped coriander for garnish\n½ “ginger slivers for garnish","instructions":"Soak the black lentils and kidney beans overnight in a bowl in plenty of water.\n\nIn a large heavy bottom sauce pan add the black lentil and kidney beans along with the water and salt.

Continue cooking for further 1 hour and 15 minutes \n\nDrain, reserving the cooking water and set aside to use for later. Mash the lentils with a potato masher this will take some arm work so keep mashing till you have a coarse consistency. You want some lentils whole but most of it mashed.\n\nIn a heavy bottom large non stick sauce pan heat the oil on a low heat. Add the asafoetida, chilli and cumin seeds.

Soak in 3 cups water overnight.\n\nIn the morning, drain the water in which the dal and rajma was soaked. Transfer the dal and rajma to a pressure cooker with 1 teaspoon salt. Add around 3.5 cups water.\n\nPressure cook on high-medium heat for 10 whistles, then lower the heat to low-medium and cook for another 10 minutes. In total around 15 to 20 whistles.\n\nLet the pressure release naturally. The dal and rajma should be completely cooked and you should be able to mash them with your fingers. If using the Instant pot, pressure cook the lentils on high pressure for 30 minutes with natural pressure release.\n\nMash some of the dal and rajma using a potato masher. Then turn on the heat to lowest heat and let the dal simmer while you make the masala.\n\nTo make the masala, in a large pot/pan, heat 2 tablespoons butter  (I use and recommend amul salted butter here) and 1 tablespoon ghee on medium heat.\n\nOnce the butter melts and is hot, add the finely grated onion. Cook the onion for around 6 to 7 minutes or until it turns light golden brown. Keep stirring it continuously so that it doesn't burn and keep heat on medium.\n\nAdd the ginger garlic paste and cook for 1 to 2 minute until the raw smell goes away.\n\nAdd the tomato puree and mix. Cook for 2 minutes or until the puree mixes well with masala and oil starts oozing out from the sides.\n\nAdd in the boiled dal (which had been simmering for around 10 to 15 min you were making the masala) and mix.\n\nAdd garam masala, kashmiri red chili powder and salt. Mix to combine.\n\nAdd 1/2 cup water, stir and set heat to low. Let it simmer on low heat uncovered for around 45 minutes.\n\nStir often (every 10 minutes or so) else dal will stick to the bottom of the pot. You will also need to add water. I added total of 1.5 cups water as the dal was simmering.\n\nAdd sugar and mix after the dal has simmered for 45 minutes.\n\nAlso add the remaining 1 tablespoon butter and 1/4 cup cream. Mix well.\n\nSimmer for 10 more minutes on low heat after adding the cream. Dal will become really creamy by now. You may serve the dal at this point or do the additional step of giving it a smokey flavor.\n\nThis last step (dhungar method) is optional but recommend. For the smokey flavor, place a steel bowl on top of a trivet placed inside the dal. Then heat a piece of charcoal over direct heat until its red hot.\n\nPlace hot charcoal in that steel bowl on top of the trivet. Pour melted ghee (around 1 tablespoon) on top of charcoal.\n\nYou will immediately see fumes coming out of charcoal. Immediately close the pan with a lid. Let it remain like this for 2 minutes. After 2 minutes, remove lid and remove the bowl from dal. The longer you keep the lid closed, the smokier dal will get and for dal makhani I don't like it very smokey so 2 minutes was good for me. You may do 5 minutes but don't do more.\n\nGarnish dal makhani with more cream and serve with a pat of amul butter.

I was hooked! All washed down with glasses of refreshing salted lassi. I always find the need to do my visits to India full justice where food is concern!\nAn Indian breakfast in my mind is always worth waking up in the mornings for. So later in the year during my trip to Mumbai I found myself devouring into Khatte Chole; lightly spiced chickpea curry with delicious bhaturas/ Indian fried bread. This home style tangy stew like dish was cooked at my friends place with piping hot bhaturas. How could anyone resist the aroma of the chole at 9am before heading to the markets to source out local produce.\nThe stew was light and had a slight tang to it with the heat from the chillies. Dipping the bhatura in the curry every mouthful was moreish. There was also an onion salad and boondi raita to cool down the heat from the dish. After a discussion of the variety of chickpea curries Sunaina aunty let me in on her recipe. A simple recipe but yet so very delicious. It’s an everyday dish and one that is full of flavour. She adds mango powder or Amchoor which lends a sharp tangy flavour to the curry. Indian food is a balance of flavours so chilli, cumin and mango powder all bring together the required heat, warmth and piquant addition to the resultant dish.\nI have tried on a few occasions to recreate her version of Khatte Chole and has been an absolute winner!

With many of the ingredients used widely even closer to home in the west of India; this sense of familiarity made cooking, exploring and eating curries from this region an absolute joy.\nPepper is such a synonymous spice in Tamil style cooking and gives dishes not just heat but depth and immense flavour. This recipe for a pepper chicken kozhumbu is an absolute winner and perfect for anyone looking for a spicy chicken curry with warmth and heat from whole spices including black pepper, cloves, fennel and dried chillies. The key here is using the ground blend of spices that is a classic in most recipes with families using stone grinders (yendra kal) to pound them realising the aromas and essential oils.\nNow of course spice grinders have made way and grind them in minutes! There isn’t any chilli powder in this kozhumbu/ curry and the green chillies add the bout of heat required although feel free to reduce the amount of chillies based on preference. I’ve used chicken drumsticks for this recipe although any cut of chicken would suffice. If you can, make this recipe in a few hours in advance as the curry gets a wonderful taste, it also give the chicken a chance to soak in all the goodness of spices. I know it’s the middle of summer although I can’t resist a plateful of pepper chicken curry with flaky paratha to mop up the delicious gravy and some yoghurt or salad in tow.","preparationTime":"5","cookingTime":"40","inactiveTime":"60","totalTime":"105","quantity":"serves 4","ingredients":"800gms chicken on the bone skinless and jointed\n7 garlic cloves roughly chopped\n1” ginger roughly chopped\n1 tsp turmeric powder\n3 tbsp vegetable oil\n10 curry leaves\n220gms white onion finely chopped\n2 birds eye green chillies slit lengthwise\n180gms tomatoes finely chopped\n250mls water\nSeason to taste\nCoriander to garnish\n2 tsp black peppercorns\n1 tsp cumin seeds\n2 mild dried red chillies\n1” cinnamon stick\n1 tsp fennel seeds\n3 cloves\n1 tsp poppy seeds\n1 tbsp coriander seeds","instructions":"Grind the garlic and ginger with a splash of water in a wet grinder to a thick paste.

Indian spices inject the required warmth, so a simple humble Dal with rice could do it or even a slow cooked Parsi spiced lamb dish.\nThis Punjabi aloo ki sabzi is a stew like potato curry that is brimming with goodness of ground spices, ginger and hearty potato.

The addition of even a little bit of spice enhances the flavours of the dish. I have always said how abundant India cuisine is when it comes to Vegetarian food. Every region brings its own take including cooking techniques, use of spices and the sheer variety of dishes on offer. With a massive part of the population steering towards a vegetarian diet and so much to choose from, its no surprise that beans, pulses, lentils, vegetables and different types of bread feature prominently in everyday home cooking. Cooking at home is all about simple flavours with ingredients that are readily (and locally) available. Indian cooking is always about delicately spiced dishes with a balance of flavour, contrary to the stereotypical hot flavours it is known for. Much of my own home cooking during the week is usual vegetarian mainly because its quick and of course really good for you too. A typical meal would include lentils (maybe dal) and a side of a dry vegetable dish along with chapattis or rice depending on preference.\nThis is a really easy yet delicious recipe for a Poriyal that hails from Tamil Nadu. You can use any vegetable although I love cooking this with spinach. Not only is it quick but works well with the spices. The key to cooking spinach poriyal is to let the greens cook without any water. As they wilt and release their moisture they begin to take on the flavour of the spices. I have used fresh grated coconut although you can swap it for desiccated coconut if you prefer. Also I love using coconut oil while cooking poriyal giving this South Indian recipe a real depth in the dish again vegetable oil would work too.","preparationTime":"5","cookingTime":"15","totalTime":"20","quantity":"serves 4","ingredients":"360gms Spinach leaves washed and chopped\n3 tbsp vegetable oil\n1 mild dried red chilli\n1 heaped tsp black mustard seeds\n1 tsp urad dal (skinned and split variety)\n10-12 curry leaves\n110gms red onion finely chopped\n½ tsp mild chilli powder/ kashmiri chilli powder\n70gms fresh grated coconut\nSalt to taste\nHandful coriander to garnish","instructions":"Heat the oil in a wok or kadhai over a medium flame.

Saying that there are very few places in India that give you the truly authentic taste of what Kashmiri food is all about. There are festivals hosted by restaurants to celebrate the cuisine including some that also boast of signature dishes as a regular part of their menus. Also a few that I have heard of including Kong poush in Mumbai and Wazwan at Baner in Pune city.\nA popular dish from Kashmir this paneer preparation is made with whole spices simmered with tomatoes along with ground ginger and fennel. My mother mentioned recently that she would ideally cook this with fresh tomatoes which are boiled whole, skinned and then added to the curry although I prefer tomato puree which gives it a thick gravy and also is a quick option. That’s my little cheat!\nThere are elements of influence from the Kashmiri pandit community here; this dish does not include garlic or onions. Like the Brahmin community in India (where I hail from) they don’t tend to add it to their dishes. Also ingredients commonly used in this regional cuisine include ginger, mustard oil and saffron. All of which lend a unique flavour.\nIf you’re unable to get hold of mustard oil feel free to swap it for regular sunflower or vegetable oil. I have also used shahi jeera a spice common to Indian curries and tandoori dishes.","preparationTime":"10","cookingTime":"20","totalTime":"30","quantity":"(Serves 4)","ingredients":"350gms Paneer diced in cubes\nMustard oil for shallow frying (or vegetable oil)\n500ml water\nPinch hing/ asafoetida\n2” cinnamon stick\n2 bay leaves\n6 green cardamom\n½ tsp shahi jeera\n3 tbsp tomato puree\n½ tsp kashmiri chilli powder (or mild paprika)\n½ tsp ginger powder\n1 tsp fennel powder\n2tbsp greek yoghurt\nPinch of saffron\nPinch of garam masala powder\nSalt to taste\nCoriander for garnish","instructions":"In a bowl add 500mls of warm water and set aside. In a frying pan heat oil and fry the cubes of paneer in batches until golden brown. The paneer might splutter slightly so make sure the heat is on medium. Drain on kitchen paper and add the fried paneer to the bowl of warm water. Let it soak while you make the curry. This helps the paneer to retain its moisture and stay soft.\n\nAdd 3 tablespoons of the oil to a heavy bottom sauce pan. Add asafoetida and let it sizzle for a few seconds. Now add cinnamon stick, bay leaves and green cardamom. Fry the spices for a minute as they begin to splutter and release their flavour into the oil. Add the shahi jeera and fry for 2-3 seconds.\n\nOn a low heat add the tomato puree. Stir well making sure it doesn’t stick to the bottom. Add the chilli, ginger and fennel powder. Stir and fry for 2 minutes as they blend with the paste. Add 350mls of the soaking paneer liquid and continue to cook on a medium heat. Bring to a boil and simmer for 5-7minutes without the lid. The curry should have a thick consistency if it is too thick add a little more of the soaking liquid.\n\nCrush the saffron into the gravy and whisk in the yoghurt. Simmer for a further 8 minutes and now tip the paneer chunks into the pot. Stir gently making sure they don’t break. You don’t really need to cook the paneer but just make sure the gravy coats the pieces well. Season to taste.\n\nGarnish with fresh coriander and pinch of garam masala powder.

Basted with melted butter while cooking the pieces get their charred edges giving it the rustic feel & sense of traditional charcoal cooking in India.\nAll too often on a late night out with friends the norm would be to visit a kebab house or street stalls churning out platefuls of kebabs, soft rotis, paneer dishes, parathas and variants of offal cooked in spices. All served with lassi, chilled refreshing fruit juices & sometimes even thums up. The stalls used to be chaotic with little place to sit so we’d always wait outside, place the order and eat on the go. I can assure you nothing beats a late night (3am!) snack fix like buttery melted cheese parathas, rotis, chicken/ lamb kebabs cooked in lashings of thick marinade all washed down with chilled fizzy thums up.\nFood is very much part of the culture in Indian communities and kebab/ tikkas are also eaten with drinks to begin a meal (or even as a snack). Skewered, grilled, baked, fried meat chunks with flavours of fresh and powdered spices served with chutneys and dipping sauces is always a winner. A sprinkling of Indian chaat masala (a mix of spices; sour mango powder, cumin & black salt) before serving and some onion rings make a drool worthy addition.\nThere are many varieties of tikkas on offer and Kali Mirch Murgh is one such chicken dish that simple & easy to cook at home. Traditionally cooked in black pepper; it’s the coarse texture of the peppercorns that infuse the succulent pieces of chicken. I have added white pepper to enhance not just the heat but also the peppery flavour. Make sure to grind them quite coarse, as they cling on to the chicken pieces lending a bout of spice warmth with every bite. My recipe uses hung yoghurt which has been strained in a muslin. The marinade should be thick and creamy to coat the chicken.

Roll out 1 pie crust to 12\" on a lightly floured surface or between two pieces of parchment paper, then transfer to the tart pan*. Press the pastry dough into the pan with your fingers to mold to the pan. Freeze for about 30 minutes, meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350˚F with the rack in the middle.\n\nPre-Bake the Crust:\n\nIf using a store-bought crust, follow the package instructions for pre-baking. Otherwise, remove the prepared pastry tart from the freezer and blind bake it by first poking the bottom with a fork about every inch or so. Next, line the tart with parchment paper or foil allowing the ends to stick out a couple of inches above the tart edges.\n\nIf using a tart pan with a removable bottom, place it on a rimmed baking sheet. Fill the inside with pie weights** 3/4 full and bake at 350˚F for about 35-40 minutes or until the tart is mostly baked through and light golden color. Remove from the oven, remove the pie weights and parchment. Brush the inside of the baked tart with a whisked egg white - this will prevent the crust from becoming soggy from the filling.  \n\nMake the Savory Egg Filling:\n\nWhile pie is pre-baking, preheat a large skillet over medium heat and add chopped bacon. Cook, stirring often until the fat is rendered and the bacon is crisp. Remove bacon with a slotted spoon to a separate dish. Add the diced onions to the bacon fat and cook stirring often until the onions are golden. Remove with a slotted spoon to the dish with the bacon.\n\nIn a large bowl whisk 4 eggs, then add 1 3/4 cups half and half, 1/2 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp pepper, 1/4 tsp paprika and 1/8 tsp of nutmeg and whisk together for about a minutes to incorporate a little bit of air into the custard. Stir in the cheese, prepared bacon and onion then pour the filling into the prebaked crust.\n\nBake the Quiche Lorraine:\n\nBake the quiche Lorraine in a preheated 350˚F oven for about 50 minutes, or until a knife inserted into the middle comes out clean and the center jiggles slightly. The quiche will continue cooking after it is removed from the oven. Cool slightly before serving and garnish with parsley if desired.","pictures":["/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/fr.recettetek/files/images/b7838d04-949b-4ac9-af45-7b7762364591.png"],"url":"https://natashaskitchen.com/quiche-lorraine/","favorite":false,"rating":0.0,"lastModifiedDate":"2020-09-25 19:35:55","uuid":-128345760,"originalPicture":"https://natashaskitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Classic-Quiche-Lorraine-Recipe-Beautiful-flaky-pastry-crust-is-paired-with-a-delicious-savory-egg-custard.-Perfect-for-breakfast-or-brunch.-1-4.jpg","categories":[{"title":"Entree"},{"title":"Breakfast"}],"tags":[{"title":"egg"},{"title":"pork"}, {"title":"French"}],"keywords":"egg;pork"},{"title":"Easy Quiche Recipe","description":"This Easy Quiche Recipe starts with a premade pie crust but no one has to know!

Huevos rancheros is a vegetarian Mexican breakfast with eggs, tortillas and salsa. Recipe yields 4 hearty but modest servings of one tortilla and egg each, so multiply the recipe if necessary.","preparationTime":"25","cookingTime":"20","totalTime":"45","quantity":"4","ingredients":"2 medium ripe tomatoes, chopped (about 1 1/2 cups)\n1/4 cup finely chopped white onion\n1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro\n2 tablespoons lime juice (about 1 medium lime)\n1/4 teaspoon fine-grain sea salt\n2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil\n1/4 cup finely chopped white onion\n1/4 teaspoon fine-grain sea salt\n1 teaspoon ground cumin\n1 can (15 ounces) black beans or pinto beans, rinsed and drained, or 1 1/2 cups cooked beans\n1/4 cup water\nFreshly ground black pepper, to taste\n1/2 teaspoon lime juice\n1 1/2 cups (12 ounces) of your favorite red salsa, either homemade or jarred\n4 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided\n4 eggs\n4 corn tortillas\n1/2 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese (optional)\nFreshly ground black pepper\nOptional garnishes: Crumbled Cotija or feta cheese, sliced avocado, additional chopped cilantro and/or hot sauce","instructions":"To prepare the pico de gallo: In a medium bowl, combine the tomatoes, onion, cilantro, lime juice, and salt. Stir to combine, then set the bowl aside for later.\n\nTo cook the beans: In a small saucepan over medium heat, warm the olive oil until shimmering. Add the onions and salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions have softened and are turning translucent, about 3 to 6 minutes.\n\nAdd the cumin and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Pour in the drained beans and water. Stir, cover and cook for 5 minutes. Reduce the heat to low, then remove the lid and use a potato masher or the back of a fork to mash up about at least half of the beans. Continue to cook the beans, uncovered, stirring often, for 2 to 3 more minutes, until thickened.\n\nRemove the pot from the heat and stir in the pepper and lime juice. Taste and add more salt, pepper or lime juice if necessary. If the beans seem dry, add a very small splash of water and stir to combine. Cover until you’re ready to serve.\n\nMeanwhile, warm the salsa. Pour the salsa into a medium saucepan over medium heat. Bring the salsa to a simmer, stirring occasionally, and then reduce the heat to low until you’re ready to serve. (Or, warm the salsa in a bowl in the microwave—it won’t condense as much but it’ll work!)\n\nIn a small skillet over medium heat, warm each tortilla individually, flipping as necessary. Spread the black bean mixture over each tortilla and place each tortilla on an individual plate. If using Jack cheese, sprinkle it over the tortillas. Set aside.\n\nTo fry the eggs: In the same skillet over medium heat, pour in 1 teaspoon olive oil and wait until it’s shimmering. Carefully crack an egg and pour it into the skillet without breaking the yolk. Fry the egg, lifting and tilting the pan occasionally to redistribute the oil, until the whites are set and the yolk is cooked to your preferred level of doneness. Place the fried egg on top of a prepared tortilla and repeat with the remaining eggs.\n\nSpoon about one-fourth of the warmed salsa across each dish, avoiding the egg yolk. Use a slotted spoon or fork to do the same with the pico de gallo, leaving the messy tomato juices behind. Sprinkle with freshly ground black pepper and add any additional garnishes you might like.\n\nServe immediately. If you don’t use up all of your beans, leftovers are a great dip for tortilla chips.","pictures":["/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/fr.recettetek/files/images/d25f0693-15bd-41e2-993e-58ccb4bd11f0.png"],"url":"https://cookieandkate.com/huevos-rancheros-recipe/","favorite":false,"rating":0.0,"lastModifiedDate":"2020-10-01 20:11:53","uuid":-1733535628,"originalPicture":"https://cookieandkate.com/images/2017/05/best-huevos-rancheros-recipe-2-225x225.jpg","categories":[{"title":"Entree"},{"title":"Breakfast"}],"tags":[{"title":"plant protein"},{"title":"vegetarian"},{"title":"egg"},{"title":"Mexican"}],"keywords":"plant protein;vegetarian;egg;Mexican"},{"title":"Cinnamon Roll Muffins","description":"These yeast-free gluten-free cinnamon roll muffins are a sweet breakfast treat that is ready much quicker than cinnamon rolls would be.","preparationTime":"25","cookingTime":"15","totalTime":"45","quantity":"12","ingredients":"2 cups gluten-free flour blend\n3/4 tsp. xanthan gum (if needed - see note)\n3 Tbsp. sugar\n3 tsp. baking powder\n1/2 tsp salt\n1 cup milk\n3 Tbsp salted butter, melted and cooled\n1 egg\n2/3 cup brown sugar\n1 Tbsp. cinnamon\n3 Tbsp. melted butter\n1/4 tsp pure vanilla extract\n3 ounces cream cheese (room temp preferred)\n3/4 cup powdered sugar\n1 Tbsp. melted butter\n1/4 tsp. pure vanilla extract\n2-4 tsp. milk","instructions":"Preheat oven to 400°.
