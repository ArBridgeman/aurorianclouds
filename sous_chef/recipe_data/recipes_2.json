One-fourth cup olive oil may seem like a lot, but it adds a lovely richness and heartiness to this nutritious soup.\n\nOnce the oil is shimmering, add the chopped onion and carrot and cook, stirring often, until the onion has softened and is turning translucent, about 5 minutes.\n\nAdd the garlic, cumin, curry powder and thyme. Cook until fragrant while stirring constantly, about 30 seconds. Pour in the drained diced tomatoes and cook for a few more minutes, stirring often, in order to enhance their flavor.\n\nPour in the lentils, broth and the water. Add 1 teaspoon salt and a pinch of red pepper flakes. Season generously with freshly ground black pepper. Raise heat and bring the mixture to a boil, then partially cover the pot and reduce the heat to maintain a gentle simmer. Cook for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the lentils are tender but still hold their shape.\n\nTransfer 2 cups of the soup to a blender. Securely fasten the lid, protect your hand from steam with a tea towel placed over the lid, and purée the soup until smooth. Pour the puréed soup back into the pot. (Or, use an immersion blender to blend a portion of the soup.)\n\nAdd the chopped greens and cook for 5 more minutes, or until the greens have softened to your liking. Remove the pot from the heat and stir in 1 tablespoon of lemon juice. Taste and season with more salt, pepper and/or lemon juice until the flavors really sing. For spicier soup, add another pinch or two of red pepper flakes.\n\nServe while hot. Leftovers will keep well for about 4 days in the refrigerator, or can be frozen for several months (just defrost before serving).","pictures":["/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/fr.recettetek/files/images/3d80e098-b56a-428b-bab5-6e66a30036a3.png"],"url":"https://cookieandkate.com/best-lentil-soup-recipe/#tasty-recipes-23764","nutrition":"calories : 367\nsugar : 10.8 g\nsodium : 1375.5 mg\nfat : 15.5 g\nsaturatedFat : 2.2 g\ntransFat : 0 g\ncarbohydrate : 47.8 g\nfiber : 10.8 g\nprotein : 14.5 g\ncholesterol : 0 mg","favorite":false,"rating":0.0,"lastModifiedDate":"2020-10-25 21:44:20","uuid":1467997889,"originalPicture":"https://cookieandkate.com/images/2019/01/best-lentil-soup-recipe-4-225x225.jpg","categories":[{"title":"Entree"},{"title":"Soup"}],"tags":[{"title":"plant protein"},{"title":"vegan"}],"keywords":"plant protein;vegan"},{"title":"Extra Vegetable Fried Rice","description":"Learn how to make vegetable fried rice—it's a simple and satisfying dinner!

Before you get started, make sure that all of your ingredients are prepped and within an arm’s reach from the stove. Also have an empty bowl nearby for holding the cooked eggs and veggies. I’m suggesting that you start over medium-high heat, but if at any point you catch a whiff of oil or food burning, reduce the heat to medium.\n\nWarm a large cast iron or stainless steel skillet over medium-high heat until a few drops of water evaporate within a couple of seconds. Immediately add 1 1/2 teaspoons of oil and swirl the pan to coat the bottom. Add the scrambled eggs and swirl the pan so they cover the bottom. Cook until they are just lightly set, flipping or stirring along the way. Transfer the eggs to a bowl and wipe out the pan with a heat-proof spatula.\n\nReturn the pan to heat and add 1 tablespoon of oil. Add the onion and carrots and cook, stirring often, until the onions are translucent and the carrots are tender, about 3 to 5 minutes.\n\nAdd the remaining veggies and salt. Continue cooking, stirring occasionally (don’t stir too often, or the veggies won’t have a chance to turn golden on the edges), until the veggies are cooked through and turning golden, about 3 to 5 more minutes. In the meantime, use the edge of your spatula or a spoon to break up the scrambled eggs into smaller pieces.\n\nUse a big spatula or spoon to transfer the contents of the pan to the bowl with the cooked eggs. Return the pan to heat and the remaining 1 tablespoon oil. Add the ginger, garlic and red pepper flakes, and cook until fragrant while stirring constantly, about 30 seconds. Add the rice and mix it all together. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the rice is hot and starting to turn golden on the edges, about 3 to 5 minutes.\n\nAdd the greens (if using) and green onions, and stir to combine. Add the cooked veggies and eggs and stir to combine. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the tamari and sesame oil. Taste, and add a little more tamari if you’d like more soy flavor (don’t overdo it or it will drown out the other flavors) or salt, if the dish needs an extra boost of overall flavor.\n\nDivide into bowls and serve immediately. I usually serve mine with chili-garlic sauce or sriracha on the side. Leftovers store well in the refrigerator, covered, for 3 to 4 days (if you used purple cabbage, it might stain your scrambled eggs a funny blue color, but it’s fine to eat).","pictures":["/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/fr.recettetek/files/images/eef012e4-1914-41aa-bf4c-b4753801a0d4.png"],"url":"https://cookieandkate.com/vegetable-fried-rice-recipe/#tasty-recipes-24427","nutrition":"calories : 400\nsugar : 24.9 g\nsodium : 1289.5 mg\nfat : 16.9 g\nsaturatedFat : 2.9 g\ntransFat : 0 g\ncarbohydrate : 54.4 g\nfiber : 11.6 g\nprotein : 11.5 g\ncholesterol : 124 mg","favorite":false,"rating":0.0,"lastModifiedDate":"2020-10-25 21:45:56","uuid":641490013,"originalPicture":"https://cookieandkate.com/images/2017/05/vegetable-fried-rice-225x225.jpg","categories":[{"title":"Side"}],"tags":[{"title":"veggies"},{"title":"Asian"},{"title":"starch"}],"keywords":"veggies;Asian;starch"},{"title":"French Dip","preparationTime":"0 hours 10 mins","totalTime":"1 hour 0 mins","quantity":"4","ingredients":"3 boneless (ribeye) steaks (about 3 pounds)\n1 tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil\n1 tbsp. kosher salt\n2 tsp. freshly ground black pepper\n2 tsp. dried oregano\n1 tsp. dried ground sage\n1/4 yellow onion, thinly sliced\n2 cloves garlic, minced\n2 tsp. minced fresh thyme\n1 1/2 c. low-sodium beef stock\n2 tsp.

Keep whisking until it comes back together, even if it takes 3-4 minutes. It will eventually– just keep whisking. Return to heat when it’s combined again.)\n\nAfter the butter has melted and combined with the caramelized sugar, cook for 2 minutes without stirring.\n\nVery slowly stir in the heavy cream.

Remove 1 cup and set aside to use in step 3; keep the rest inside the food processor. Add the cake flour and salt to the food processor. Pulse 5-10 times until sugar/flour/salt mixture is aerated and light.\n\nIn a large bowl using a hand mixer or a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, whip egg whites and cream of tartar together on medium-low until foamy, about 1 minute. Switch to medium-high and slowly add the 1 cup of sugar you set aside. Whip until soft peaks form, about 5-6 minutes. See photo and video above for a visual. Add the vanilla extract, then beat just until incorporated.\n\nIn 3 additions, slowly sift the flour mixture into the egg white mixture using a fine mesh strainer, gently folding with a rubber spatula after each addition. To avoid deflating or a dense cake, don’t add the flour mixture all at once. Sift and very slowly fold in several additions. This is important! Pour and spread batter into an ungreased 9 or 10 inch tube pan. Shimmy the pan on the counter to smooth down the surface.\n\nBake the cake until a toothpick inserted comes out clean, about 40-45 minutes. Rotate the pan halfway through baking. The cake will rise up very tall while baking. Remove from the oven, then cool the cake completely upside-down set on a wire rack, about 3 hours. (Upside-down so the bottom of the tube pan is right-side up, see photo and video above.) Once cooled, run a thin knife around the edges and gently tap the pan on the counter until the cake releases.\n\nIf desired, dust with confectioners’ sugar.

In a small bowl, mix together the butter, salt, thyme, rosemary, and black pepper.\n\nAfter the prime rib has come to room temperature, pat it down with paper towels to make sure it's dry. Then rub the entire outside of the prime rib with the herb butter mixture.\n\nPlace the prime rib in an oven-safe pan or roasting tray with the bones-side down, fat-side up. Place the onion slices in the pan around the meat, if you're making the red wine au jus. If not, you can omit the onions.\n\nCook the prime rib in the center of the oven for 20 minutes at 450F. It should get a nice sear on the outside. If not, cook it a few minutes longer. Then reduce the temperature of the oven to 325F and continue cooking until the internal temperature reaches 120F (about an hour and a half), for medium-rare. But go by temperature, not time, as it will depend on the size of your prime rib and your oven.\n\nRemove the prime rib from the oven and let it rest for 20-30 minutes. You can tent it with aluminum foil to keep it warm. Then, remove the string and bones, and slice it up into thick 1/2\" slices.\n\nRed Wine Au Jus\n\nAfter you've removed the fat from the pan, add up to 1/4 cup of drippings back in along with the beef broth and red wine. If you have leftover herbs, you can toss those in as well.\n\nSimmer this for about 15 minutes, or until the liquid has reduced by half. It's meant to be a thin sauce, but if you'd like to add a little bit of a thickener, you can do that as well. Strain the au jus to remove the onion and any browned bits, then drizzle over the prime rib.","pictures":["/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/fr.recettetek/files/images/cb00d87f-60fd-40f1-9870-b13531ebd54e.png"],"url":"https://downshiftology.com/recipes/best-prime-rib/","nutrition":"calories : 1129 kcal\ncarbohydrate : 3 g\nprotein : 47 g\nfat : 100 g\nsaturatedFat : 43 g\ncholesterol : 225 mg\nsodium : 1193 mg\nfiber : 1 g\nsugar : 1 g\nservingSize : 1 serving","favorite":false,"rating":0.0,"lastModifiedDate":"2020-12-14 06:51:41","uuid":933706621,"originalPicture":"https://i2.wp.com/www.downshiftology.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Prime-Rib-10.jpg","categories":[{"title":"Entree"}],"tags":[{"title":"beef"},{"title":"holiday"},{"title":"comfort food"},{"title":"British"},{"title":"dutch oven"}],"keywords":"beef;holiday;comfort food;British;dutch oven"},{"title":"Hot Chocolate","description":"This is hands down the best hot chocolate you'll ever taste!

Cover and allow to rest for 5 minutes.\n\nAdd the remaining water, olive oil, salt, and 1 cup (130g) flour. Beat on low speed for 20 seconds, then add 3 and 1/2 cups (440g) more flour. Beat on low speed for 2 minutes. If the dough is still sticking to the sides of the bowl, add the last 1/2 cup (60g) of flour. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. With lightly floured hands, knead the dough for 3-4 minutes. The dough can be a little too heavy for a mixer to knead it, but you can certainly use the mixer on low speed instead. If the dough is too sticky as you knead, add more flour 1 Tablespoon at a time. The dough should still feel a little soft, but shouldn’t stick your hands. Poke it with your finger – if it slowly bounces back, your dough is ready to rise. If not, keep kneading.\n\nLightly grease a large bowl with a teaspoon of oil or some nonstick spray– just use the same bowl you used for the dough. Place the dough in the bowl, turning it to coat all sides in the oil. Cover the bowl with aluminum foil, plastic wrap, or a clean kitchen towel. Allow the dough to rise at room temperature for 2-3 hours or until double in size. (Tip: For the warm environment on a particularly cold day, heat your oven to 150°F (66°C). Turn the oven off, place the dough inside, and keep the door slightly ajar. This will be a warm environment for your dough to rise. After about 30 minutes, close the oven door to trap the air inside with the rising dough. When it’s doubled in size, remove from the oven.)\n\nGenerously grease a 12×17 inch baking pan (with at least 1 inch tall sides) with 2 Tablespoons of olive oil. This is the base layer of the bread, so be generous with the oil. A pastry brush is helpful to spread it.\n\nWhen the dough is ready, punch it down to release any air bubbles. Place on the oiled baking pan, then stretch and flatten the dough to fit the pan. Don’t tear the dough. If it’s shrinking (mine always does), cover it with a clean towel and let it rest for 5-10 minutes before continuing. This lets the gluten settle and it’s much easier to shape after that.\n\nCover the dough tightly and let it rest in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour and up to 24 hours. The longer it rests, the better the flavor. I recommend at least 12 hours.\n\nRemove the dough from the refrigerator and let it sit at room temperature as you preheat the oven and prepare the toppings. Keep it covered. It may rise a little during this time, but not much.\n\nPreheat oven to 450°F (232°C). Allow it to heat for at least 10-15 minutes so every inch of the oven is very hot.\n\nWhisk the 3 remaining Tablespoons of olive oil with the minced garlic and herbs. Set aside.\n\nUsing your fingers, dimple the dough all over the surface. You can watch me do this in the video above. Drizzle on the olive oil topping and use your hands or a pastry brush to spread it all over the top. Add a little more olive oil if needed so the dough is completely covered. (This creates the crisp crust!) Sprinkle with a little coarse salt and freshly ground black pepper.\n\nBake for 20-23 minutes or until lightly browned on top. If desired, broil on high for the last minute to really brown the top.\n\nCut and serve hot or let it come to room temperature before slicing and serving. Focaccia tastes wonderful warm or at room temperature. Cover leftover focaccia tightly and store at room temperature for 2 days or in the refrigerator for 1 week. You can also freeze the baked and cooled focaccia for up to 3 months. Thaw in the refrigerator or at room temperature. To reheat the slices, you can use the microwave or bake in a 300°F (149°C) oven for 5 minutes.","pictures":["/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/fr.recettetek/files/images/7c0ff7bd-9b7b-44fd-a0b2-530011f0f2f3.png"],"url":"https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/garlic-rosemary-herb-focaccia/","favorite":false,"rating":0.0,"lastModifiedDate":"2020-12-29 21:10:54","uuid":1049459442,"originalPicture":"https://cdn.sallysbakingaddiction.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/garlic-rosemary-herb-focaccia-225x225.jpg","categories":[{"title":"Dough"}],"tags":[{"title":"Italian"}],"keywords":"Italian"},{"title":"Croque monsieur","description":"Master the croque monsieur with soft sourdough, gruyère, smoked ham and creamy mustard mayo.

Add the pancetta and cook until the fat has rendered and the pancetta is crispy, 5 to 8 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the pancetta to a paper-towel-lined plate, leaving the fat in the pan.\n\nSeason the chicken all over with 2 teaspoons salt and ½ teaspoon pepper. Increase the heat to medium-high and brown half of the chicken in a single layer, skin side down, until golden and crispy, about 5 minutes (brown on the skin side only). Using tongs, transfer the chicken to a plate; set aside. Repeat with the remaining chicken. Pour off all but about 2 tablespoons of the fat.\n\nReturn the pot to the stove and reduce the heat to medium-low. Add the onions to the pot and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are softened and just starting to brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 1 minute more. Add the Cognac and cook, stirring to scrape the brown bits from the bottom of the pan, until the Cognac has evaporated. Add the wine, chicken broth, tomato paste, balsamic vinegar, sugar, thyme, bay leaf, and ½ teaspoon salt. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium and gently boil, uncovered, for 15 minutes.\n\nAdd the chicken and any accumulated juices from the plate back to the pot, along with the carrots. Bring to a simmer, then cover and cook over low heat for 30 minutes, or until the chicken and carrots are cooked through.\n\nWhile the chicken cooks, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the mushrooms and 1/4 teaspoon salt and cook, stirring frequently, until the mushrooms are golden brown, about 5 minutes. Set aside.\n\nAlso while the chicken cooks: In a small bowl, mash the softened butter and flour to make a smooth paste. Set aside.\n\nUsing a slotted spoon, transfer the cooked chicken to a plate.\n\nIncrease the heat in the Dutch oven/pot to medium and stir in three-quarters of the flour and butter paste. Gently boil until the sauce is thickened, 5 to 7 minutes; add the remaining paste if you'd like the sauce a little thicker. Fish out and discard the bay leaf.\n\nUsing a fork and knife, pull the skin off of the chicken and discard.\n\nAdd the chicken and any accumulated juices back to the pot and simmer, uncovered, for about 10 minutes. Right before serving, stir in the browned mushrooms and pancetta. Taste and adjust seasoning, if necessary, then serve.\n\nMake-Ahead Instructions: Let cool to room temperature and then store in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. Reheat over medium-low heat on the stovetop before serving. (For best results, store the sautéed mushrooms and crispy pancetta in separate containers in the refrigerator and add before serving.)\n\nFreezer-Friendly Instructions: This can be frozen for up to 3 months. Before serving, defrost the stew in the refrigerator for 24 hours and then reheat on the stovetop over medium-low heat until hot.\n\nNote: Sometimes chicken thighs have excess skin and/or fat. Before cooking, using kitchen shears, trim any skin that extends farther than the edges of the chicken thigh, and snip off any excess fat.","pictures":["/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/fr.recettetek/files/images/88a565c7-6143-4f78-8290-295b712cecdd.png"],"url":"https://www.onceuponachef.com/recipes/coq-au-vin.html#tabbox","favorite":false,"rating":0.0,"lastModifiedDate":"2020-12-29 22:02:29","uuid":1138358722,"originalPicture":"https://www.onceuponachef.com/images/2020/01/Coq_au_vin-1200x1576.jpg","categories":[{"title":"Entree"}],"tags":[{"title":"poultry"},{"title":"holiday"},{"title":"French"},{"title":"dutch oven"}],"keywords":"poultry;holiday;French;dutch oven"},{"title":"Spiced Indian Cabbage","description":"Make and share this Spiced Indian Cabbage recipe from Food.com.","preparationTime":"10","cookingTime":"10","totalTime":"20","quantity":"2-4 serving(s)","ingredients":"2 cups chopped cabbage\n1 -2 green chili\n1/4 teaspoon mustard seeds\n1/4 teaspoon cumin seed\n1/4 teaspoon turmeric powder\n1/4 teaspoon garam masala\n1/2 teaspoon ginger paste\n1/2 teaspoon garlic paste\n1/2 cup chopped onion\n1 teaspoon oil\n1 teaspoon chopped cilantro\n1 dash asafoetida powder\nsalt","instructions":"Heat the oil.\n\nAdd the cumin and mustard seeds.\n\nAdd the asafoetida powder.\n\nAdd ginger, garlic, chillies and onions.\n\nCook till the onions are a little soft.\n\nAdd the cabbage.\n\nAdd salt and turmeric powder.\n\nCook till the consistency which you like your cabbage to be cooked. *I cook about 5 minutes because I like my cabbage crunchy.\n\nAdd chopped cilantro.\n\nServe with Indian bread.\n\nVariations:.\n\nI have these variations which I use depending on what I am in the mood for\n\n1.

Georgia Southern and Alabama Blue certainly don’t sound exotic, but these heirloom varieties are the stars of country cooking.” In the rest of the country, collards are often misunderstood and thought to be the food of the poor. In the past, the only way collards were prepared was simmered, sometimes boiled in water, along with strips of bacon, ham hocks, or fatback. This method is still very popular and incredibly delicious, but Virginia has believes it is time to fresh look at this Southern staple. In this recipe, she pairs collard greens with rice, another favorite Southern ingredient, to create a savory and flavorful dish hearty enough to be served as a main entrée.

About 5 minutes.\n\nNow take a potato masher, and smash all the jackfruit up to get that shredded texture. If you find it a bit wet, just cook a little longer. If you find it a little dry, just add a splash more vegetable broth.\n\nTo assemble the tacos:\n\nWarm the taco shells according to the package directions. When warmed, add a scoop of the jackfruit, and top with an avocado slice, a couple red onion slices, some cilantro, and a squeeze of lime juice. Or you can top with whatever your favourite taco toppings are! I also love a squeeze of hot sauce. ","pictures":["/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/fr.recettetek/files/images/bf9a0b77-a38b-45fa-b2cc-828a96634bb3.png"],"url":"https://itdoesnttastelikechicken.com/easy-vegan-jackfruit-tacos/","nutrition":"calories : 265 kcal\nservingSize : 1 taco\ncarbohydrate : 49 g\nprotein : 2 g\nfat : 8 g\nsaturatedFat : 1 g\nsodium : 188 mg\nfiber : 5 g\nsugar : 3 g","favorite":false,"rating":0.0,"lastModifiedDate":"2021-01-23 10:47:25","uuid":1681777461,"originalPicture":"https://itdoesnttastelikechicken.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/easy-vegan-jackfruit-tacos-recipe-mexican-vegetarian.jpg"},{"title":"Garlic aioli","preparationTime":"5","cookingTime":"0","totalTime":"5","quantity":"3 portions","ingredients":"4 garlic cloves, minced\n2-3 tbsp Greek yogurt\n1 tbsp mayonnaise\n1 tbsp lemon juice\n2 tsp black pepper\n1 tsp salt\n1 tsp garlic powder\n(1 tsp paprika powder)\n","instructions":"Mix very well.","favorite":false,"rating":4.0,"lastModifiedDate":"2021-01-23 18:36:35","uuid":-1295861676,"categories":[{"title":"Sauce & dip"},{"title":"Dressing"}],"tags":[{"title":"American"}],"keywords":"American"},{"title":"Tiramisu","preparationTime":"380","totalTime":"380","quantity":"Makes 8 Servings","ingredients":"1/2 cup (120 ml) brewed espresso or very strong coffee, at room temperature\n1/4 cup (60 ml) dry Marsala wine, divided\n2 teaspoons vanilla extract\n3 large egg yolks\n1/4 cup (50 grams) granulated sugar, divided\n8 ounces (225 grams) mascarpone cheese (about 1 1/4 cups)\n3/4 cup (175 ml) heavy cream\n18 to 20 Savoiardi Italian ladyfingers (from 7-ounce package)\n1 ounce (30 grams) bittersweet chocolate or cocoa powder for dusting\n\n(TRY with more chocolate flavoring!)","instructions":"!

And my curiousity was piqued. I mean, crusts are always about the butter no? And we all know very well that butter is not exactly healthy. So I decided to try the recipe out to see how it taste like.\n\nAsparagus Leeks Roasted Cherry Tomatoes Quiche\n\nAsparagus; Roasted cherry tomatoes\n\nThe dough was very unlike my other usual butter crust, and the texture was really stretchy and elastic-y. Not sure how to explain clearly, but oh well nevermind. Feeling a bit apprehensive, I decided to prebake the dough first though it wasn't stated in the original recipe to do so.\n\nNuh ah. Wrong move. I'm not sure what I did wrong anywhere, but the resulting dough was nowhere near the flaky crust described by those who tried the recipe (the website and comments below). The crust was edible I guess, but it wasn't exactly enjoyable. I'm wondering if I should try it again (maybe half the recipe this time round) without prebaking it to see whether it makes any difference.\n\nBut anyway, no need to worry, even if the crust was a failure, the filling was delicious. It is pack full of vegetables (it's meatless!) and the colours are really pretty before and after it was baked. I loved how the roasted tomatoes were really sweet. A big slice of this goes a long way to fill me up for lunch.\n\nI'd recommend my trusty crust for any quiches (recipe > here), but no harm giving the bottom healthier recipe a try first since it's what made me make a quiche in the first place.

Fry the pancetta, turning it frequently so that it browns and crisps on all sides; this takes about 10 minutes. Remove it with a slotted spoon and drain it on paper towels. Leave the heat on and the renderings in the pan. (With a well-seasoned cast iron, this should be all the fat you need to cook the remainder of the hash. If you’re not using a cast iron, you might need to add a tablespoon or so of oil; if you’ve skipped the pork, you’ll want to start with 2 tablespoons oil.)\nAdd the potatoes don’t move them for a couple minutes. Use this time to season them well with salt and pepper. Once they’ve gotten a little brown underneath, begin flipping and turning them, then letting them cook again for a few minutes. The idea is not to fight them off the frying pan, once they’ve gotten a little color, it’s easier to flip them and you’ve gotten closer to your goal of getting them evenly browned. \nWhen the potatoes are about three-fourths as crisped and brown as you’d like them — this takes about 15 minutes — add the onion. (I add this now, not earlier, because I find it often burns before the potatoes are done.) Cook for an additional 5 minutes. Add the asparagus, cover the pan and cook for 5 to 8 minutes, or until crisply cooked. (Skinny asparagus will take just 5 minutes; thicker asparagus will take longer.) Remove the lid, return the pancetta to the pan for another minute, to reheat. Taste for seasoning and adjust if needed.

I usually just take kitchen shears and quickly snip off any excess skin or fat. Cracked green olives are olives that have been ‘cracked’ or split open before curing, allowing the brine or marinade to penetrate. You can find them in your supermarket’s olive bar, or substitute any green olive that you like.\n\nMake-Ahead: After you have completed the step of cooking the carrots, the dish can be refrigerated for up to 2 days.

This classic recipe uses fresh tomatoes, chickpeas, and lentils.","preparationTime":"2:09","totalTime":"2","ingredients":"3 tablespoons vegetable oil\n1/2 pound lamb (or beef or chicken), chopped into 1/2-inch pieces\n6 large tomatoes, peeled, seeded, and pureed\n1 tablespoon kosher salt\n1/2 teaspoon turmeric (or 1/4 teaspoon yellow food coloring)\n1 bunch parsley, leaves only, finely chopped (about 1/4 cup)\n1 bunch cilantro, leaves only, finely chopped (about 1/4 cup)\n1 stalk celery with leaves, finely chopped\n1 1/2 teaspoons pepper\n1 teaspoon ground cinnamon\n1 tablespoon ground ginger\n1 large onion, grated\n1 handful dried chickpeas, soaked overnight and peeled\n1 tablespoon smen, optional\n11 cups water, divided\n3 tablespoons dried lentils, soaked overnight\n3 tablespoons tomato paste, mixed into 1 cup water\n2 tablespoons uncooked rice, optional\n2 tablespoons broken vermicelli\n1 cup flour\n2 cups water\nChopped parsley, garnish","instructions":"Steps to Make It Hide Images\n\nNote: While there are multiple steps to this recipe, this soup is broken down into workable categories to help you better plan for preparation and cooking. Before starting, be sure your chickpeas and lentils are soaked, the herbs are cleaned and chopped without any large stems, and the tomatoes are pureed in a blender or food processor. Alternatively, stew the tomatoes and pass them through a food mill to remove the seeds and skin.\n\nBrown the Meat\n\nGather the ingredients.\n\nThe Spruce\n\nHeat up the cooking oil in a 6-quart or larger pressure cooker. Add the meat.\n\nThe Spruce\n\nCook for a few minutes, stirring to brown all sides.\n\nThe Spruce\n\nMake the Stock\n\nAdd the pureed tomatoes, kosher salt, turmeric, parsley, cilantro, celery, pepper, cinnamon, ginger, onion, chickpeas, and smen (if using). Stir and add 3 cups of the water.\n\nThe Spruce\n\nCover tightly and heat over high heat until pressure is achieved. Reduce the heat to medium and cook for 20 to 30 minutes. Remove from the heat and release the pressure.\n\nMake the Soup\n\nAdd the lentils, tomato paste mixture, and the remaining 8 cups (2 quarts) of water. If at any point there's an oily surface forming on top of the soup, simply skim it off and discard. This can happen because of the meat's fat, if left on.\n\nThe Spruce\n\nHave the rice or vermicelli at hand, if using, but don't add yet.\n\nThe Spruce\n\nCover the pot and heat the soup over high heat until pressure is achieved. Reduce the heat to medium and continue cooking.\n\nIf adding rice, cook the soup on pressure for 30 minutes. Release the pressure and add the rice. Cover and cook with pressure for an additional 15 minutes. Taste for seasoning and add salt and pepper if desired.\n\nIf using vermicelli, cook the soup on pressure for 45 minutes. Release the pressure, and add the vermicelli. Simmer the soup, uncovered, for 5 to 10 minutes or until the vermicelli is plump and cooked. Taste for seasoning and add salt and pepper if desired.\n\nThe Spruce\n\nMake Soup Thickener\n\nWhile the soup is cooking, make a soup thickener by mixing together the flour and water.\n\nThe Spruce\n\nMix well, but if the mixture is not smooth, pass it through a sieve to remove lumps.\n\nThe Spruce\n\nFinish the Soup\n\nBring the soup to a full simmer. Slowly, and in a thin stream, pour in 1/4 of the flour mixture. Stir constantly and keep the soup simmering so the flour doesn’t stick to the bottom or cooks up in lumps.\n\nThe Spruce\n\nAdd another 1/4 of the flour thickener. You will notice the soup beginning to thicken when you've used approximately half the flour mixture. The thickness of harira is up to you.\n\nThe Spruce\n\nSimmer the thickened soup, stirring occasionally, for 5 to 10 minutes to cook off the taste of the flour. Remove the soup from the heat, serve, and garnish with some chopped parsley.\n\nThe Spruce\n\nEnjoy.\n\nCan I Cook the Harira Without a Pressure Cooker? \n\nYes. Here's how:Use an 8-quart stockpot. Follow the directions above, but adjust the cooking time as follows:In the \"Make the Soup\" section, partially cover the pot, bring to a simmer, and cook for double the suggested pressure cooker times—either 60 minutes if using rice or 90 minutes if using vermicelli. Watch the level of the liquid and add a little more water if necessary.Proceed with thickening the soup according to the recipe, or try the egg thickening method below.\n\nThickening with Egg\n\nIn place of flour and water, 2 or 3 beaten eggs may be used to thicken harira:Beat the eggs with 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice. Add the eggs in a thin stream to the simmering soup, stirring constantly. You will see some cooked strands of eggs in the soup as it thickens.\n\nShortcuts \n\nHere are some helpful tips to reduce the prep time:Process the cilantro, parsley, and celery together in a food processor or blender. Add the peeled and seeded tomatoes and blend until well pureed. Add the onion and process until the onion is reduced to small pieces. Add to the browned meat.If you plan to cook harira frequently, it’s helpful to prep large amounts of key ingredients in advance, like soaking, peeling, and then freezing chickpeas, or chopping an ample supply of parsley, cilantro, and celery, freezing them together in batch-sized amounts. Additionally, peeling, seeding, and stewing tomatoes for freezing can reduce prep time.\n\nRecipe Tags:\n\nTomato\n\nmoroccan soup\n\nside dish\n\nmoroccan\n\nRate This Recipe\n\nI don't like this at all.\nIt's not the worst.\nSure, this will do.\nI'm a fan—would recommend.\nAmazing!

When ready to use, drain. Although they are normally stewed directly in the broth, you may want to tie the soaked lentils in cheesecloth, which allows you to offer them on the side in the event someone at the table doesn't care for them.\n\nIf you'll be cooking a regular chicken, you may also want to soak your lentils for a few hours, as it will help them to cook faster.\n\nIn a large, heavy-bottomed pot, mix the chicken with the onions, olive oil, salt, pepper, ginger, turmeric, and ras el hanout spices. Stir to coat the chicken well, cover, and set aside to marinate for a few hours or overnight in the refrigerator.\n\nMake and shred the msemen or trid pastry into bite-size pieces – note that it's easiest to shred the msemen while they're hot – OR plan to make the msemen while the chicken and lentils are simmering on the stove.\n\nCook the Chicken and Lentils\n\nPlace the chicken on the stove over medium heat and cook, covered, stirring occasionally, for about 15 to 20 minutes, until a rich sauce has formed.\n\nFollow one of these methods, depending on the type of chicken you're cooking:\n\nIf using a free-range chicken, add the drained fenugreek seeds, saffron, parsley, cilantro and 4 to 5 cups of water. Cover and simmer over medium-low to medium heat for about one hour. Add the lentils and continue cooking, covered, for another hour or longer, until the chicken and lentils are quite tender. Add water during the cooking if necessary to ensure that rich, ample broth is left in the pot.\n\nIf using a regular, factory-raised chicken, add the drained lentils, drained fenugreek seeds, saffron, parsley, cilantro and 3 to 4 cups of water. Cover and simmer over medium-low to medium heat for about one hour, or until the lentils are tender and the chicken is well-cooked. (Remove the chicken if the lentils do not yet test done; it can be returned to the pot to reheat once the lentils have finished cooking.) There should be ample, rich broth in the pot; if there's not, add a little water, taking care not to dilute the seasoning.\n\nTaste the broth and adjust seasoning. Add the teaspoon of smen, swirling the pot to mix it into the broth.\n\nIf desired, remove the chicken from the pot and place it under a broiler for a few minutes to brown and crisp the skin.\n\nServe the Chicken Rfissa\n\nShortly before serving time, heat a little water in the base of a couscoussier. Place the shredded msemen in the steamer basket over the water, and steam for about 10 minutes, until tender and heated through.\n\nArrange the msemen on a large serving dish. Add the chicken to the bed of msemen, and distribute most of the broth, onions, and lentils over the chicken and msemen. Reserve a bowlful or two of broth to offer on the side.\n\nIf you tied the fenugreek in cheesecloth, you can also offer the fenugreek in a bowl on the side.\n\nMoroccan tradition is to gather around this single large dish, with each person eating from his own side of the plate by hand or with a spoon.\n\nGlass Bakeware Warning\n\nDo not use glass bakeware when broiling or when a recipe calls to add liquid to a hot pan, as glass may explode. Even if it states oven-safe or heat resistant, tempered glass products can, and do, break occasionally.\n\nRecipe Tags:\n\nLentil\n\nmoroccan chicken\n\ndinner\n\nmoroccan\n\nRate This Recipe\n\nI don't like this at all.\nIt's not the worst.\nSure, this will do.\nI'm a fan—would recommend.\nAmazing!

Season each breast with a pinch of sea salt, cover with cling film and place in the fridge to marinate for at least 10 minutes and up to a few hours.\n\nTo make the yoghurt sauce, put the yoghurt, fresh mint and sumac in a small serving bowl. Season with a generous pinch of sea salt and some black pepper. Mix well until the sumac and mint are evenly incorporated.\n\nFor the ras-el-hanout chicken wraps, preheat a large frying pan over a medium heat. Add the remaining olive oil and the chicken breasts (you may want to use two pans at a time if cooking all four chicken breasts at once). Fry the chicken for about 8-10 minutes on one side and 6-8 minutes on the other side. You can check how cooked the chicken is by prodding the fattest part of the chicken strips with your finger - if it feels very springy then it needs to cook a bit longer. Check the chicken is cooked by piercing the thickest part with a skewer or small knife. If the juices run clear and the flesh is no longer pink then the chicken is cooked and ready to serve. Place your cooked chicken on a chopping board and allow to rest for a few minutes before slicing into strips.\n\nTo serve, put a few strips of chicken on each tortilla wrap, add a dollop of the yoghurt sauce and then drizzle with pomegranate molasses.

Meanwhile, heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add guajillo and arbol chiles to the skillet and toast, flipping occasionally, until fragrant and lightly toasted, about 1 minute. Transfer toasted chiles to a plate to rest until water is boiling.\n\nOnce the water is boiling, add toasted chiles to the pot along with the tomatoes. Cover, lower heat to medium, and simmer for 5 minutes. Remove pot from heat and let sit for 10 minutes to soften and rehydrate the dried chiles.\n\nWhile the chiles and tomatoes are soaking, heat olive oil in the same skillet over medium-high heat.

Taste and adjust seasoning as needed.\n\nCarefully add blended sauce back to the same skillet (it may splatter, so be careful!). Cook for 1 minute over medium heat, stirring often. Adjust heat to low. Use a large spoon to make 4 small wells in the sauce and crack an egg into each well (see notes).\n\nIf you want to lower the spice level in this recipe, simply omit the chile de arbol peppers.

Give it a taste once it’s blended, and if it’s not spicy enough, add a chile de arbol pepper.
